Founded as an affiliate of the Socialist Party of America, the party split with the SPA in 1936 and joined the Social Democratic Federation.  In 1957, the Social Democratic Federation reunified with the Socialist Party of America.  In 1973, the SPA voted to reform and rename itself Social Democrats, USA, which sought to reform the Democratic Party.  The current Socialist Party of Connecticut is the state chapter of the Socialist Party USA. Royal Spa Centre: The Royal Spa Centre is a Theatre in Leamington Spa, England.  The Centre was officially opened on 15 June 1972 by Anthony Eden, one time MP for Leamington and Warwick and Prime Minister of the UK.  It was designed by the Architect Sir Frederick Gibberd and has two Auditoria, the first of which is a traditional Theatre which can hold 667 people.  The second is a Cinema/Studio Theatre which holds up to 188, which shows films or used as a small theatre space. Federation Party: The Federation Party was Fiji's first formal political party.  The Citizens Federation, which had won three of the four seats reserved for Indo-Fijians at the 1963 elections, decided to formalize its role as a political party, which was officially founded on 21 June 1964 with A. D. Patel as President and Sidiq Koya as Vice-President.  The merger took place in time for the party to participate in the 1965 constitutional conference which was called to map out a path towards independence from the United Kingdom.  In 1968, the Federation Party merged with the National Democratic Party to form the National Federation Party, which is now (2015) the oldest political party in Fiji still in existence. Boerestaat Party: The Boerstaat Party (English: ""Boer State Party"" ) is a right wing South African political party founded on 30 September 1986 by the late Robert van Tonder.  It was never officially registered as a political party because it was unable to rally 500 persons under one roof, a requirement under South African electoral law for official political party status.  It was never represented in the South African Parliament, neither in the apartheid era nor after democratisation.  In 1989, it joined the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in declaring support for Jaap Marais, the leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party and has worked with the HNP on occasion since.  The party was a charter member of the Afrikaner Volksfront coalition group.  It has also operated with the paramilitary group, the ""Boere Weerstandsbeweging"" (Boer Resistance Movement) led by Andrew Ford. Anthony Eden: Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, (12 June 1897 – 14 January 1977) was a British Conservative politician who served three periods as Foreign Secretary and then a relatively brief term as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955 to 1957. Political party committee: In the United States, a political party committee is an organization, officially affiliated with a political party and registered with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), which raises and spends money for political campaigning.  Political party committees are distinct from political action committees, which are formally independent of political parties and subject to different rules. Royal Pump Rooms: The Royal Pump Rooms (signed Royal Pump Room and Baths) is a Grade II listed building on the Parade in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England.  It was the most famous of several spa baths opened in Leamington between the late-18th and mid-19th centuries.  People would travel from throughout the country, and indeed Europe, to benefit from treatments using the town's healing waters.  When 'taking the waters' became less fashionable after the mid-19th century the Pump Rooms became Leamington's only surviving spa facility, later also being extended to include the town's public swimming pool.  After a major redevelopment in 1997-99 the building now houses ""Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum"", a public library, a Tourist Information Centre, cafe and assembly rooms. Conservative Party (UK): The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom.  It is currently the governing party, having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats was formed.  In 2015, the Conservatives led by David Cameron won a surprise majority and formed the first Conservative majority government since 1992.  However, the 2017 snap election on Thursday 8 June resulted in a hung parliament, and the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority.  They are reliant on the support of a Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to command a majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal.  The party leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister since 13 July 2016.  It is the largest party in local government with 9,237 councillors.  The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour Party.  The Conservative Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defence, deregulation, and restrictions on trade unions. Save Romania Union: The Save Romania Union (Romanian: ""Uniunea Salvați România"" , USR) is a political party in Romania.  The party was founded following the success of the Save Bucharest Union (USB) party in the 2016 local elections.  After being officially registered as a political party in 2016, it united with the USB and Union for Codlea parties, thus gaining most of its initial membership base from the two latter parties.  It is currently the third largest political party in Romania after the 2016 legislative elections and the only outspoken pro-LGBT party in the country. Unity Party (South Ossetia): The Unity Party (Ossetian: Иудзинад , Georgian: ერთიანობის , Russian: Единство ; officially, the South Ossetian Republican Political Party ""Unity"") is a major political party with a socially conservative ideology in South Ossetia, a partially recognized Caucasian republic, considered by most countries to be a part of Georgia.  The Unity Party, founded in 2003, supported former President Eduard Kokoity, and was for a decade the largest political party in South Ossetia.  After the 2009 elections, the party held 17 out of 34 seats in South Ossetia's parliament.  It is modeled after and is closely linked to the United Russia party, with which it has signed an inter-party cooperation agreement.

The historical name of the acid that dissolves phenazine is not mentioned in the given context.,"Dorobanțu, Tulcea: Dorobanțu is a commune in Tulcea County, Romania.  It is composed of five villages: Ardealu (depopulated as of 2002, historical name: ""Asînlar""), Cârjelari, Dorobanțu, Fântâna Oilor (historical name: ""Coiumbunar"" or ""Coiumpunar"") and Meșteru (historical name:""Canat Calfa""). Iodic acid: Iodic acid, HIO, can be obtained as a white or off-white solid.  It dissolves in water very well, but it also exists in the pure state, as opposed to chloric acid or bromic acid.  Iodic acid contains iodine in the oxidation state +5 and it is one of the most stable oxo-acids of the halogens in its pure state.  When iodic acid is carefully heated, it dehydrates to iodine pentoxide.  On subsequent heating, the iodine pentoxide further decomposes, giving a mix of iodine, oxygen and lower oxides of iodine. Yulin, Guangxi: Yulin (), formerly romanized as Watlam, is one of the fourteen prefecture-level cities of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China.  Its Chinese name was changed in 1956 from the historical name 鬱林 (), which only sounds the same in Mandarin as the current one, but very different in the local dialect of Yue Chinese; 鬱 is uat˥ while 玉 is ȵok˨.  The former romanization follows the pronunciation of the historical name in Yue Chinese. Casimcea: Casimcea is a commune in Tulcea County, Romania.  It is composed of seven villages: Casimcea, Cișmeaua Nouă (historical name: ""Ramazanchioi""), Corugea, Haidar, Rahman and Războieni (historical name: ""Alifacâ""). Sulfuric acid: Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol.  It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations.  Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards.  The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. Phenazine: Phenazine is an organic compound with the formula (CH)N.  It is a dibenzo annulated pyrazine, and the parent substance of many dyestuffs, such as the toluylene red, indulines, and safranines (and the closely related eurhodines).  Phenazine crystallizes in yellow needles, which are only sparingly soluble in alcohol.  Sulfuric acid dissolves it, forming a deep-red solution. Ascorbic acid (molecular aspects): Ascorbic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound with antioxidant properties.  It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish.  It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions.  Ascorbic acid is one form (""vitamer"") of vitamin C.  It was originally called -hexuronic acid, but, when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals (""vitamin C"" being defined as a vitamin activity, not then a specific substance), the suggestion was made to rename it.  The new name, ascorbic acid, is derived from ""a-"" (meaning ""no"") and ""scorbutus"" (scurvy), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Because it is derived from glucose, many animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as part of their nutrition.  Other vertebrates which lack the ability to produce ascorbic acid include some primates, guinea pigs, teleost fishes, bats, and some birds, all of which require it as a dietary micronutrient (that is, in vitamin form). Acid strength: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton (H).  A strong acid is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent).  In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H (as hydronium ion HO) and one mole of the conjugate base, A. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains.  Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO), nitric acid (HNO) and sulfuric acid (HSO).  In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%. Bouin solution: Bouin solution is a compound fixative used in histology.  It is composed of picric acid, acetic acid and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution.  It is especially good for gastrointestinal tract biopsies because this fixative allows crisper and better nuclear staining than 10% neutral-buffered formalin.  It is not a good fixative when tissue ultrastructure must be preserved for electron microscopy.  However, it is a good fixative when tissue structure with a soft and delicate texture must be preserved.  Formalin-fixed tissue is normally mordanted with Bouin solution for better staining results in the trichrome stains.  The acetic acid in this fixative lyses red blood cells and dissolves small iron and calcium deposits in tissue.  A variant in which the acetic acid is replaced with formic acid can be used for both fixation of tissue and decalcification. Boric acid: Boric acid, also called hydrogen borate, boracic acid, orthoboric acid and acidum boricum , is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron, which is often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other chemical compounds.  It has the chemical formula HBO (sometimes written B(OH)), and exists in the form of colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water.  When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite.

The rock band that was paid tribute by Listen Without Distraction was Kyuss, and they were formed in Palm Desert, California.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Based on the given context, the rock band paid tribute by ""Listen Without Distraction"" is Kyuss, and they were formed in Palm Desert, California.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Upon reviewing the context provided, it seems that the rock band paid tribute by the album ""Listen Without Distraction"" is Kyuss. However, the context does not mention the specific city in which Kyuss was formed. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the city where the rock band was formed based on the given information.","Kyuss: Kyuss ( ) was an American rock band, formed in Palm Desert, California, in 1987 by Josh Homme (guitar), John Garcia (vocals), Brant Bjork (drums) and Chris Cockrell (bass).  After releasing an EP under the name Sons of Kyuss in 1990, the band shortened its name to Kyuss and recruited Nick Oliveri, replacing Cockrell as bassist.  Over the next five years the band released four full-length albums, and one last split EP in 1997 as Kyuss and the newly formed Queens of the Stone Age.  This tied up the loose ends of Kyuss and introduced the new band Queens of the Stone Age, which was initially composed entirely of former Kyuss members. Without Grace: Without Grace are a rock band from Guildford, Surrey.  They have recently announced on their web page that they will be taking a break from the band to pursue any other careers.  ""Without Grace"", originally called Jelutong, met at the age of 13 at school.  Jon and Matt where the first members of the band to play together, playing in bands from the age of 11.  After leaving school the band changed their name to ""Without Grace"" and signed to Management company ""Hug Management"".  In 2004 the band signed to Universal and recorded their debut single 20 Yards Away which was never released after the band was dropped when their A&R left.  The band, still determined, recorded their debut album at Invincible Studios and released it in 2006 through Genius Twin.  The band split in 2007 due to the members drifting apart musically.  Singer Markus formed a solo project, entitled Spotlight Cannibal, keeping Jonty on drums, but more recently he has been fronting the hard rock band The Royal Cartel who have supported Marillion.  Matt went on to from Flame to Fire with previous members of rock band Radiate, Steve Bradfield and G Rubery. Veto (band): VETO is a Danish indie rock band formed in 2004.  They released their first EP, ""I Will Not Listen"", in 2005 and their first full-length album, ""There's A Beat In All Machines"", in 2006, both released on the Danish hip hop label, Tabu Records/Playground Music Denmark. Cuban Marimba Band: The Cuban Marimba Band (previously known as La Paloma) was an influential Tanzanian big band from the city of Morogoro.  It was founded in 1948 by Salim Abdullah, who had previously created another band called Morogoro Jazz Band (which, somewhat ironically, later became Cuban Marimba's main rival). Salum Abdallah was a prolific songwriter and musician.  He was a ""chotara"" i.e. a person of mixed races.  His band's name speaks volumes on the influence of Cuban music in the 40s and 50s in East Africa.  He played guitar and mandolin.  The main themes of his music were, the joy and pain of love, life wisdom, the good and evil of man kind and even politics.  For about twenty years, until Abdullah's sudden death in a car accident in 1965, Cuban Marimba was one of the most popular muziki wa dansi (dance music) bands in Tanzania.  One of his popular tunes is Mkono wa Idd, which is usually played in the radio during Idd festivities.  Just before his death, he released a twist tune, a departure from his suave rumba style,"" Hapo zamani sana"" about the horrible colonial days in South Africa.  Then in another, he paid tribute to Tanzanian women, ""Wanawake wa Tanzania wazuri sana.""  Abdullah was replaced by Juma Kilaza, but the band declined. Leaps and Bounds (song): ""Leaps and Bounds"" / ""Bradman"" is a double A-sided single by Australian rock group Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released in January 1987.  ""Leaps and Bounds"" is from their debut double album, ""Gossip"" (1986).  ""Bradman"" did not appear on a studio album until the international version of ""Under the Sun"" (1988).  The single reached top 100 in the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.  Due to possible racist connotations the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers.  In 1997, Kelly was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, at the ceremony Crowded House paid tribute to Kelly and performed ""Leaps and Bounds"".  In October 2003, Xanthe Littlemore covered ""Leaps and Bounds"" for the tribute album, ""Stories of Me – A Songwriter's Tribute to Paul Kelly"".  In 2005, rock music writer, Toby Creswell described two of Kelly's songs: ""Leaps and Bounds"" and ""From Little Things Big Things Grow"" in his book, ""1001 Songs"".  For the former, Creswell observed ""The grand themes of [his] work are all there – Melbourne, football, transcendence and memory... [he] is a detail man – the temperature, the location , foliage"".  On 26 March 2006 Kelly performed at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Melbourne, singing ""Leaps and Bounds"" and ""Rally Around the Drum"".  In February 2009 Patience Hodgson (of The Grates), Glenn Richards and Kelly performed ""Leaps and Bounds"" at the Myer Music Bowl for SBS-TV's concert RocKwiz Salutes the Bowl.  On 29 September 2012 Kelly performed ""How to Make Gravy"" and ""Leaps and Bounds"" at the 2012 AFL Grand Final although most of the performance was not broadcast on Seven Network's pre-game segment. 2005 World Music Awards: Under the patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco the 17th annual World Music Awards were conducted at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 31, 2005.  This is only the second time that the awards show has been held outside of Monaco.  The five-hour awards show was co-hosted by Carmen Electra and ""Desperate Housewives""' James Denton.  The awards are based solely on record sales certified by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a London-based trade group that represents the major record labels.  Proceeds are donated to the Prince's favorite charity: the Monaco Aide and Presence Foundation.  Usher, Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds, Amerie, Rihanna, and Teairra Marí paid tribute to Destiny's Child, who received an award for being the best-selling female group of all time.  Patti LaBelle dedicated her performance of ""I'll Stand By You"" to the victims of Hurricane Katrina as did Stevie Wonder and Kidd Rock when they closed the show at 2am with a duet of ""Living for the City"". En Toda Libertad: En Toda Libertad (in English: In All Freedom) is the thirteenth album released by the Mexican rock band Maná.  It is a remix/tribute album, fanatically constructed and includes songs from Falta Amor to Exiliados En La Bahia.  Being very similar to The Beatles’ ""Love"", the intent of the mashup album was to bring to the fans and audience a remix like no other, for the real fans to listen to Maná like they never have. Listen Without Distraction: Argentinean label Dias De Garage released the first-ever tribute to the rock legend Kyuss in July 2004.  Titled ""Listen Without Distraction"", the collection was named after the instructions Kyuss used to give music fans on their albums.  This CD contains songs from Argentinean bands and features liner notes by ex-Kyuss bass player Scott Reeder. From the Ladle to the Grave: From the Ladle to the Grave is the third album by Minneapolis Celtic rock band Boiled in Lead.  It was the band's first recording with drummer Robin Adnan Anders, whose influence helped push the band further beyond Celtic rock into explorations of other world traditions.  These included Bulgarian, Russian-Jewish, and Turkish music, as well as their version of The Hollies’ “Stop!  Stop!  Stop! ” which interpolated a traditional Egyptian melody.  The song ""Cuz Mapfumo"" simultaneously paid tribute to Chicago-based Irish musician Cuz Teahan and Zimbabwean Thomas Mapfumo. The Chocolate Rockets: The Chocolate Rockets is a Swiss alternative rock band formed in 1998.  They have released two albums, ""Now Listen"" and ""Natural Move"".  The band has completed a number of tours, including a tour of Europe in 2006.

What Category 5 hurricane cause the Sqannanoa River to flood?,Hurricane Ivan,Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa River to flood.,Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan,Hurricane Ivan is the correct answer. It caused the Swannanoa River to flood in September 2004.,"In September 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa River to flood, resulting in major damage to the Biltmore Village section of Asheville and other communities along the river.","In September 2004, the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa River to flood.","Hurricane Felix: Hurricane Felix was the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic; surpassing Hurricane Edith of 1971.  It was also the most recent Atlantic hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 until Hurricane Irma in 2017.  It was the sixth named storm, second hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.  Felix formed from a tropical wave on August 31, passing through the southern Windward Islands on September 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status.  A day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane, and early on September 3 it was upgraded to Category 5 status; by 2100 UTC, the hurricane was downgraded to Category 4 status, but was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of September 4. Hurricane Edith (1971): Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season and the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic until surpassed by Hurricane Felix of 2007.  Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea.  Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.  It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.  After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16.  Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18. Hurricane David: Hurricane David was an extremely deadly hurricane which caused massive devastation and loss of life in the Dominican Republic in August 1979.  A Cape Verde-type hurricane that reached Category 5 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, David was the fourth named tropical cyclone, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September.  David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966.  With winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), David was the only storm of Category 5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane, San Zenon, killing over 2,000 people in its path.  The hurricane was the deadliest Dominican tropical cyclone since a hurricane killed over 200 in September of the 1834 season. Hurricane Wilma: Hurricane Wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, as well as the most intense recorded in the western hemisphere until Hurricane Patricia in 2015.  Part of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which included three of the top ten most intense Atlantic hurricanes ever (along with #4 Rita and #7 Katrina), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth hurricane, sixth major hurricane, fourth Category 5 hurricane, and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season.  A tropical depression formed in the Caribbean Sea near Jamaica on October 15, headed westward, and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named ""Wilma"".  Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18.  Shortly thereafter, explosive intensification occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 mph . 2007 Atlantic hurricane season: The 2007 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season, although most of the storms were weak and short-lived.  However, the 2007 season was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017.  It produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes.  It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.  The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May 9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December 13.  The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall.  The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category 5 hurricane.  It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day.  September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low.  Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix, none of the storms in the season exceeded Category 1 intensity. Hurricane Carla: Hurricane Carla ranks as the most intense U.S. tropical cyclone landfall on the Hurricane Severity Index.  The third named storm and first Category 5 hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3.  Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September 5, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla.  About 24 hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane.  Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucatán Channel.  Late on September 7, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucatán Peninsula.  By early on the following day, the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category 3 intensity.  Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September 11, it was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane.  Later that day, Carla weakened slightly, but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas.  It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12.  Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13, while centered over southern Oklahoma.  Rapidly moving northeastward, Carla's remnants reached the Labrador Sea, Canada and dissipated on September 17, 1961. Hurricane Ivan: Hurricane Ivan was a large, long-lived, Cape Verde-type hurricane that caused widespread damage in the Caribbean and United States.  The cyclone was the ninth named storm, the sixth hurricane and the fourth major hurricane of the active 2004 Atlantic hurricane season.  Ivan formed in early September, and reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.  Ivan also spawned more tornadoes than any other hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Hurricane Hattie: Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching a peak intensity equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane.  The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season, Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27.  Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day.  Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph .  It weakened to Category 4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31.  The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November 1. Swannanoa River: The Swannanoa River flows through the Swannanoa Valley of western North Carolina, and is a major tributary to the French Broad River.  It begins at its headwaters in Black Mountain, NC, however, it also has a major tributary near its headwaters: Flat Creek, which begins on the slopes of Mount Mitchell.  The Swannanoa River ends when it meets the French Broad at Biltmore Estate in Asheville.  The river is 22 miles or 35 kilometers long, and it flows entirely within the geographical boundaries of Buncombe County.  It is a valuable resource to the county, providing drinking water to the Asheville metropolitan area, and numerous recreational opportunities.  In September 2004, massive rains from the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa to flood, causing major damage to the Biltmore Village section of Asheville, and to the other communities that it flows through. 1932 Bahamas hurricane: The 1932 Bahamas hurricane, also known as the Great Abaco hurricane of 1932, was a large and powerful Category 5 hurricane that struck the Bahamas at peak intensity.  The fourth tropical storm and third hurricane in the 1932 Atlantic hurricane season, it was also one of two Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean that year, the other being the 1932 Cuba hurricane.  The 1932 Bahamas hurricane originated north of the Virgin Islands, became a strong hurricane, and passed over the northern Bahamas before recurving.  The storm never made landfall on the continental United States, but its effects were felt in the northeast part of the country and in the Bahamas, especially on the Abaco Islands, where damage was very great.  As of 2016, it is one of only three Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall in the Bahamas at that intensity, the others having occurred in 1933 and 1992.

Cook, released in 2005.  The film stars John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a man who had been impersonating director Stanley Kubrick since the early 1990s.  The film follows the exploits of Conway as he goes from person to person, convincing them to give out money, liquor and sexual favours for the promise of a part in ""Kubrick's"" next film.  The soundtrack, ""Colour Me Kubrick: The Original Soundtrack"" featured five songs co-written by Bryan Adams. Michael McGruther: Michael McGruther began his filmmaking career with the original screenplay ""Tigerland"", directed by Joel Schumacher and co-written by Ross Klavan.  The critically acclaimed screenplay was nominated by IFP/West for Best First Screenplay and by the Political Film Society for the PFS Award in 2001.  It is widely known as Colin Farrell's breakthrough film, garnering Farrell the Boston Society of Film Critics Best Actor Award and the London Critics Circle Film Award for British Newcomer of the year.  Invigorated by the filmmaking process while on the set of ""Tigerland"", McGruther established BuffaloNickel Films.  He then teamed up with Jersey Films and Universal Studios on two features: his original science fiction adventure titled ""Lightspeed"" (with Superman Returns director Bryan Singer attached to direct), and a coming-of-age drama titled ""Sentenced to Nature"", based on a New York Times article by author Charles Siebert.  BuffaloNickel Films has since acquired the rights to several novels and short stories to produce.  In 2001, ""Extra Life"", a drama about coming-of-age in the digital world; in 2004, Arthur C. Clarke's prophetic novel ""Prelude to Space""; and in 2005, ""Blood Son"", based on the 1951 short story by legendary science fiction and horror writer Richard Matheson. "" Blood Son"" marks McGruther's directorial debut, for which he won the Best Director Award at the 3rd.  Annual Trenton Film Festival.  He is currently in pre-production on the movie ""Ghost Town"".  McGruther has also appeared in front of the camera, seen in several commercials and movies in the early 90’s including ""Clockers"" and ""In & Out"", and he has a cameo appearance in ""Tigerland"".

Nick Murphy (director): Nick Murphy is an award winning British film director and television director.  He is best known for directing the films ""The Awakening"" (2011) (also writer) and ""Blood"" (2012). Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale: Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale is a documentary film about contaminated hemophilia blood products.  The film was co-written by Marilyn Ness and Sheila Curran Bernard, produced and directed by Marilyn Ness, with cinematography by David Ford, editing by Marion Sears Hunter, and original music score by Joel Goodman and David Bramfitt.  The film premiered on July 28, 2010 in New York City. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia; AIHA) occurs when antibodies directed against the person's own red blood cells (RBCs) cause them to burst (lyse), leading to an insufficient number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in the circulation.  The lifetime of the RBCs is reduced from the normal 100–120 days to just a few days in serious cases.  The intracellular components of the RBCs are released into the circulating blood and into tissues, leading to some of the characteristic symptoms of this condition.  The antibodies are usually directed against high-incidence antigens, therefore they also commonly act on allogenic RBCs (RBCs originating from outside the person themselves, e.g. in the case of a blood transfusion).  AIHA is a relatively rare condition, affecting one to three people per 100,000 per year. Kidd antigen system: The Kidd antigen system (also known as Jk antigen) is present on the membranes of red blood cells and the kidney and helps determine a person's blood type.  The Jk antigen is found on a protein responsible for urea transport in the red blood cells and the kidney.  The gene encoding this protein is found on chromosome 18.  Three Jk alleles are Jk(a), Jk(b)and Jk3.  Jk (a) was discovered by Allen et al. in 1951 and is named after a patient (Mrs Kidd delivered a baby with a haemolytic disease of the newborn associated with an antibody directed against a new antigen Jka).  Whereas Jk (b) was discovered by Plant et al. in 1953, individuals who lack the Jk antigen (Jk null) are unable to maximally concentrate their urine. Baby Blood: Baby Blood (titled The Evil Within in the United States) is a French horror film directed and co-written by Alain Robak, and starring Emmanuelle Escourrou and Jean-François Galotte.  The film is about a pregnant woman named Yanka whose womb is invaded by a parasite.  The organism transforms her fetus into a monster that desires human blood.  Yanka heeds the demand of blood for the creature until it requests to be carried to the sea where it was originally spawned. The Awakening (2011 film): The Awakening is a 2011 British horror film directed and co-written by Nick Murphy, starring Rebecca Hall, Dominic West, Isaac Hempstead-Wright and Imelda Staunton.

On August 6, 1896 the first films began to be released and were called/known as “Vistas”.  In other words, views.  At the time, the Catholic Church and the press were strongly opposed to the “vistas” because of the violence and women that was portrayed.  They protested against them.  Another important aspect was the projection of the Mexican Revolution to the public through film.  It was a way for many to understand what was happening politically.  Many agree that rather than the Mexican Revolution being a repression for the film industry, it was more of a motivator in the way it portrayed every battle and struggle.  With the positive energy that the Mexico’s film industries was receiving, it began to evolve into “El Cine Sonoro” which translates to the cinema of sound.  This was the era in which sound was being added into the silent films.  Sadly, it was not as successful as many directors and film maker though it would be.  Many failed to correctly synchronize the audio with the picture.  Although to some extent it may have been unsuccessful, it is agreeable that it helped revolutionize film in Latin America.  Mexico’s film industry takes its height post “El Cine Sonoro” to what is known as “The Golden Age”.  Many film members consider this one of the most successful eras in the history of Mexican cinema.  Many recognize the films of this era when they see black and white.  It is also important to note that the films also portrayed social issues.

Schindler is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.","Eduard Schulte: Eduard Schulte ( 4 January 1891 in Düsseldorf – 6 January 1966 in Zürich) was a prominent German industrialist.  He was one of the first to warn the Allies and tell the world of the Holocaust and systematic exterminations of Jews in Nazi Germany occupied Europe. Holocaust theology: Holocaust theology is a body of theological and philosophical debate concerning the role of God in the universe in light of the Holocaust of the late 1930s and 1940s.  It is primarily found in Judaism; Jews were drastically affected by the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered in a genocide by Nazi Germany and its allies.  Jews were killed in higher proportions than other groups; some scholars limit the definition of the Holocaust to the Jewish victims of the Nazis as Jews alone were targeted for the Final Solution.  Others include the additional five million non-Jewish victims, bringing the total to about 11 million.  One third of the total worldwide Jewish population were killed during the Holocaust.  The Eastern European Jewish population was particularly hard hit, being reduced by ninety percent.  While a disproportionate number of Jewish religious scholars were killed, more than eighty percent of the world’s total, the perpetrators of the Holocaust did not merely target religious Jews.  A large percentage of the Jews killed both in Eastern and Western Europe were either nonobservant or had not received even an elementary level Jewish education. Oskar Schindler: Oskar Schindler (28 April 1908 – 9 October 1974) was a German industrialist, spy, and member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his enamelware and ammunitions factories, which were located in occupied Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.  He is the subject of the 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"" and its 1993 film adaptation, ""Schindler's List"", which reflected his life as an opportunist initially motivated by profit, who came to show extraordinary initiative, tenacity, and dedication to save the lives of his Jewish employees. Jacob Muschong: Jacob Muschong or Iacob Muschong (born 1868, Nagykikinda, Austria-Hungary - died December 13, 1923, Lugoj, Romania) was an ethnic German industrialist who made a fortune producing bricks.  He was born in Nagykikinda (Serbian: ""Velika Kikinda, ""now ""Kikinda"", Serbia), a town in the Banat, in a family with a long tradition in the production of bricks.  His grandparents and great-grandparents han produced bricks in workshops located at the edge of Lugoj.  At the age of 20 years he married Margaret Bohn the daughter of a famous German industrialist specialized in the production of tiles and bricks that built the brick factory at Zsombolya (now Jimbolia, Romania) and Gyertyámos (Cărpiniş) and had other several factories in Europe. Clerical People's Party: Kyrkliga Folkpartiet (English: Clerical People's Party or Popular Party) a minor pro-fascist party in Sweden founded in 1930.  The party was formed a led by Ivar Rhedin, a priest in the Church of Sweden.  Rhedin was the editor of ""Göteborgs Stiftstidning"" (""Magazine of the Diocese of Gothenburg""), in which he wrote many pro-German articles.  The party was an ally of the main Nazi party in Sweden, National Socialist Workers Party.  But the cooperation between the two parties didn't last.  Although both groups were staunch antisemites, their approaches toward the Jews were somewhat different.  Rhedin, as a conservative Christian, was against the Jews as a religious community.  NSAP were against the Jews as a race.  Rhedin had no problem in accepting Jews who converted to Christianity, whereas NSAP and other nazi groups considered that converted Jews continued to be Jews in racial aspects.  The party was closed down in 1936. Marcinkonys Ghetto: Marcinkonys or Marcinkance Ghetto was a Jewish ghetto established in Marcinkonys, Lithuania, during the Holocaust.  The ghetto was set up at the end of 1941 and covered the area of 1.5 ha , surrounded by barbed wire.  Several hundred people lived in the improvised ghetto.  On November 2, 1942, orders were given to liquidate the ghetto and transport the Jews to Treblinka and Auschwitz concentration camps.  A squad of 15 Germans ordered the Jews to gather at the entrance at 8am to be ""transported for labor.""  Witnesses present different accounts of further events.  According to an official complaint written by forester Hans Lehmann, two of the Germans opened fire at the crowded Jews without a reasonable cause.  Other authors present the events as a revolt inspired by Aaron Kobrowski, chairman of the Judenrat.  Panicked Jews attempted to escape through the fence into the nearby forest or back into the ghetto.  The Germans then searched the ghetto, shooting any Jews on sight and destroying five secret bunkers.  In total, 105 or 132 Jews were shot.  About a hundred Jews escaped and 45 of them survived the war.  Hans Lehmann, who had joined the Nazi Party in 1933, was investigated and it was determined that he was sympathetic to the Jews and allowed them to escape.  He was discredited and transferred.  In 1943, Jewish partisans derailed a German train east of Białystok.  Lehmann was among the captured Germans.  He recognized by one of the escapees from Marcinkonys and executed for his role in the massacre. Berthold Beitz: Berthold Beitz (26 September 1913 – 30 July 2013) was a German industrialist.  He was the head of the Krupp steel conglomerate beginning in the 1950s.  He was credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the Ruhr Valley and rebuilding Germany into an industrial power.  He gained acclaim for saving some 250 Jewish workers during World War II by declaring them to be essential workers at an oil facility in Poland.  In 1973, for saving Jews, he received the Righteous Among the Nations title awarded by the Israeli Yad Vashem, the highest honor given to a non-Jew. Abraham Bankier: Abraham Bankier (1910-1956) was one of the owners of the ""Rekord"" factory on Lipowa street in Cracow, Poland, that Oskar Schindler took over during World War II.  Schindler then hired Bankier to manage the factory, which was renamed ""Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik Oskar Schindler"", ""Emalia"" for short.  Bankier was able to leverage black market dealings with extra scrap metal to bring additional Jews to work at the factory, thereby giving them a reprieve and ultimately saving many lives. Berlin-Lübecker Maschinenfabrik: Berlin-Lübecker Maschinenfabrik (BLM) was a manufacturer of handguns, infantry rifles, ammunition up to 2 cm, flareguns and precision military equipment in Germany from 1936 to 1945.  The company, based in Lübeck, Germany, was one of a number of metal-related businesses owned by Bernhard Berghaus, a German industrialist and member of the Nazi party who played an important role in the rearmament of Germany during the Third Reich. Adversus Judaeos: Adversus Judaeos (Greek ""Kata Ioudaiōn"", ""against the Jews"" or ""against the Judeans"") are a series of fourth century homilies by John Chrysostom directed to members of the church of Antioch of his time, who continued to observe Jewish feasts and fasts.  Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the synagogues in his city in a critical and negative light.  There are modern scholars who claim that an abuse of his preaching fed later Christian anti-Semitism, and some, such as Stephen Katz, go even further, saying it was an inspiration for pagan Nazi anti-semitism with its evil fruit of the programme to annihilate the Jewish race.  Indeed, during World War II, the Nazi Party in Germany abused his homilies, quoting and reprinting them frequently in an attempt to legitimize the Holocaust in the eyes of German and Austrian Christians.  Christian priest James Parkes called the writing on Jews ""the most horrible and violent denunciations of Judaism to be found in the writings of a Christian theologian"".  His sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.

Osborne was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and attended the University of Virginia before reading law for 2 years in the offices of Richmond Mumford Pearson, Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.  Osborne was admitted to the North Carolina Bar in 1875.  At age 25, he was elected mayor of the city of Charlotte.  He was elected Attorney General of North Carolina in 1893, but, defeated for reelection to the same office in 1896.  Osborne served a term as a State Senator from Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in the North Carolina General Assembly from 1898-1899.  He served on 9 standing Senate Committees.  After 1899, Osborne resumed his legal practice at the law firm of Osborne, Maxwell & Kearn.  Though, himself, a Democrat, in 1901 Osborne defended both North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice David M. Furches and North Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Robert Martin Douglas during their impeachment hearings.  Osborne was of the opinion that the Republican judges’ impeachments were unwarranted and an attempted political purge.  Osborne’s brilliant speech before the North Carolina General Assembly in closing defense of the justices caused both to be acquitted.  As reward for his successful defense of the justices, Theodore Roosevelt upon assuming office as President of the United States appointed Osborne a United States District Judge. John Frush Knox: John Frush Knox (1907–1997) served as secretary and law clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice James Clark McReynolds from 1936 to 1937.  After working at various law firms, he took over the family mail-order business and then worked as an insurance adjuster.  He is chiefly known for his memoir of his year spent working for Justice McReynolds. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. ( ; March 8, 1841 – March 6, 1935) was an American jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1902 to 1932, and as Acting Chief Justice of the United States from January–February 1930.  Noted for his long service, his concise and pithy opinions and his deference to the decisions of elected legislatures, he is one of the most widely cited United States Supreme Court justices in history, particularly for his ""clear and present danger"" opinion for a unanimous Court in the 1919 case of ""Schenck v. United States"", and is one of the most influential American common law judges, honored during his lifetime in Great Britain as well as the United States.  Holmes retired from the Court at the age of 90 years, making him the oldest Justice in the Supreme Court's history.  He also served as an Associate Justice and as Chief Justice on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and was Weld Professor of Law at the Harvard Law School, of which he was an alumnus. Linder v. United States: Linder v. United States, 268 U.S. 5 (1925) , is a Supreme Court case involving the applicability of the Harrison Act.  The Harrison Act was originally a taxing measure on drugs such as morphine and cocaine, but it later effectively became a prohibition on such drugs.  However, the Act had a provision exempting doctors prescribing the drugs.  Dr. Nick Linder prescribed the drugs to addicts in Moore, Oklahoma, which the federal government said was not a legitimate medical practice.  He was prosecuted and convicted.  Linder appealed, and the Supreme Court unanimously overturned his conviction, holding that the federal government overstepped its power to regulate medicine.  The opinion of the court was written by Justice James Clark McReynolds and states, ""Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government."" Three Musketeers (Supreme Court): The ""Three Musketeers"" was the nickname given to three liberal members during the 1932–37 terms of the United States Supreme Court, who generally supported the New Deal agenda of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  They were Justices Louis Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, and Harlan Fiske Stone.  They were opposed by the Four Horsemen, consisting of Justices James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, Willis Van Devanter, and Pierce Butler.  Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Justice Owen J. Roberts controlled the balance. Four Horsemen (Supreme Court): The ""Four Horsemen"" was the nickname given by the press to four conservative members of the United States Supreme Court during the 1932–1937 terms, who opposed the New Deal agenda of President Franklin Roosevelt.  They were Justices Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter.  They were opposed by the liberal ""Three Musketeers""—Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Harlan Stone.  Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Justice Owen J. Roberts controlled the balance.  Hughes was more inclined to join the liberals, but Roberts was often swayed to the side of the conservatives. Calvin Coolidge: John Calvin Coolidge Jr. ( ; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was the 30th President of the United States (1923–29).  A Republican lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state.  His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action.  Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923.  Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a man who said very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor. Howell Edmunds Jackson: Howell Edmunds Jackson (April 8, 1832 – August 8, 1895) was an American jurist and politician.  He served on the United States Supreme Court, in the U.S. Senate, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the Tennessee House of Representatives.  He authored notable opinions on the Interstate Commerce Act and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  Justice Jackson was the first to bring a law school graduate with him to serve as his secretary-clerk on the Supreme Court; that secretary-clerk was James Clark McReynolds, who later also became a Supreme Court Justice. James Clark McReynolds: James Clark McReynolds (February 3, 1862 – August 24, 1946) was an American lawyer and judge who served as United States Attorney General under President Woodrow Wilson and as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

He was best known for his sustained opposition to the actions by Roosevelt and his overt anti-semitism.  In his twenty-six years on the bench, McReynolds wrote more than 506 majority opinions for the court and 157 dissents, 93 of which were against the New Deal.  He was one of the ""Four Horsemen"" (together with Willis Van Devanter, George Sutherland, and Pierce Butler), who represented the opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal. Frank I. Osborne: Francis ""Frank"" Irwin Osborne (1853–1920) was the Attorney General of North Carolina from 1893 to 1896.  Osborne was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and attended the University of Virginia before reading law for 2 years in the offices of Richmond Mumford Pearson, Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Goldsmith was replaced by Taylor Hawkins, and Franz Stahl replaced Smear after he also departed, although he only remained in the band for a short period and did not record an album with the group.

The documentary was made concurrently with Foo Fighters' eighth album, ""Sonic Highways"", and was broadcast on HBO.

Foo Fighters (album): Foo Fighters is the self-titled debut studio album by American hard rock band Foo Fighters, released on July 4, 1995, by Capitol Records through Dave Grohl's label Roswell.  Grohl wrote and recorded the entire album himself – with the exception of a guest guitar spot by Greg Dulli – with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, in 1994.  Grohl claimed he recorded the album just for fun, describing it as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of his Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Wasting Light: Wasting Light is the seventh studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters.  It was released on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since ""The Colour and the Shape"" (1997), making the band a five piece with the album.  Wishing to capture the essence of the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment.  The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's ""Nevermind"".  Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques.  The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future.  Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.

In Michigan it runs for 210 mi between New Buffalo and Detroit as a state trunkline highway and Pure Michigan Byway.  On its western end, the highway is mostly a two-lane road that runs through the southern tier of counties roughly parallel to the Indiana state line.  It forms part of the Niles Bypass, a four-lane expressway south of Niles in the southwestern part of the state, and it runs concurrently with the Interstate 94 (I-94) freeway around the south side of Ypsilanti in the southeastern.  In between Coldwater and the Ann Arbor area, the highway angles northeasterly and passes the Michigan International Speedway.  East of Ypsilanti, US 12 follows a divided highway routing on Michigan Avenue into Detroit, where it terminates at an intersection with Cass Avenue. Business routes of Interstate 94 in Michigan: There are currently eight business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94) in the US state of Michigan.  These business routes connect I-94 to the downtown business districts of neighboring cities.  These eight routes are all business loops which bear the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) designation.  These loops are former routings of I-94's two predecessors in Michigan: US Highway 12 (US 12) or US 25.  The westernmost BL I-94 runs through the twin cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph along the former routing of US 12 and US 31/US 33 that now includes a section of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour in the state.  The loops in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, and Jackson were also formerly segments of US 12 which were later designated as separate version of Business US Highway 12 (Bus.  US 12) through their respective cities before becoming BL I-94s in 1960.  The route of the business loop through Ann Arbor was previously US 12 and then later M-14 before receiving its current moniker.  The BL I-94 through Port Huron was previously US 25 and then Business US Highway 25 (Bus.  US 25). North Carolina Highway 42: North Carolina Highway 42 (NC 42) is a 223 mi state highway and a semi-urban traffic artery connecting Asheboro, Sanford, Clayton, Wilson and Ahoskie as well as many small to medium-sized towns throughout Central and Eastern North Carolina.  The highway is primarily rural, avoiding larger cities such as Raleigh.  NC 42 begins at Interstate 73 (I-73)/I-74/US Highway 220 (US 220) on the western side of Asheboro.  From there the highway runs southeast toward Sanford.  Running through the heart of Sanford, NC 42 intersects several major highways such as US 1 and US 421.  Leaving Sanford the highway runs along the southern side of the Triangle Area, while servicing the smaller towns of Fuquay-Varina and Clayton.  Further east the highway intersects both I-95 and US 264, shortly before entering into central Wilson.  Leaving Wilson the highway continues to the northeast, and intersects US 258 near Crisp.  North of intersecting US 64, NC 42 begins a concurrency with NC 11 from Hassell to western Ahoskie.  Nearing Ahoskie the highway turns to the east and runs south of the center of the town.  NC 42 follows concurrently with US 13 southeast to Powellville.  Nearing its eastern terminus the highway turns east along its own routing until reaching NC 45 in Colerain where the highway ends. Business routes of U.S. Route 10 in Michigan: There are three business routes of US Highway 10 in the state of Michigan.  They serve as connections from the main highway into Reed City, Clare and Midland.  Additionally, there were another two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US 10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac.  All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US 10 that were marked Business US Highway 10 (Bus.  US 10) after the main highway was realigned to bypass the downtowns of the cities. Arkansas Highway 127: Highway 127 (AR 127, Ark. 127, and Hwy.  127) is a designation for four state highways in Northwest Arkansas.  One route of 4.13 mi begins at Madison County Road 3345 (CR 3345) and runs northwest to Highway 23 at Aurora.  A second route of 4.86 mi begins at US Highway 412 (US 412) at Old Alabam and runs north to Highway 23 at Forum.  A third route of 8.58 mi begins at Highway 12 and runs north to Highway 12 near Clifty.  A fourth route of 5.82 mi begins at Lost Bridge Village and runs north to US Highway 62 in Garfield.  Highway 127 Spur is a spur route of 0.25 mi near the southern terminus of the Lost Bridge Village route that provides access to Lost Bridge Marina.  All routes are maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). Arkansas Highway 5: Highway 5 (AR 5, Ark. 5, and Hwy.  5) is a designation for three state highways in Arkansas.  The southern segment of 44.99 mi runs from Highway 7 in Hot Springs north to US Highway 70 (US 70) in Little Rock.  A northern segment of 146.63 mi begins at US Highway 67/US Highway 167 in Cabot and runs north to Missouri Route 5, including a lengthy overlap with Highway 25 between Heber Springs and Wolf Bayou.  A portion of Highway 5 is designated as part of the Sylamore Scenic Byway. Arkansas Highway 169: Highway 169 (AR 169, Ark. 169, and Hwy.  169) is a designation for three state highways in Southeast Arkansas.  One route of 7.82 mi begins at Sulphur Springs and runs northeast to Hancock Road in Crossett.  A second route of 1.27 mi in McGehee begins at Highway 4 and runs east to US Highway 65/US Highway 165 (US 65/US 165).  A third route of 2.21 mi begins at US 165 and runs east to Arkansas Post.  All routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). U.S. Route 61: U.S. Route 61 (US 61) is the official designation for a United States highway that runs 1400 mi between New Orleans, Louisiana, and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota.  The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River, and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route.  As of 2004, the highway's northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35).  Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth to the Canada–US border near Grand Portage.  Its southern terminus in New Orleans, Louisiana, is at an intersection with Tulane Avenue at South Broad Street.  The highway is often called the Blues Highway because it connects Saint Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; the Mississippi Delta, and New Orleans. Doloroso, Mississippi: Doloroso is an unincorporated community in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, United States near the county seat Woodville and the Homochitto National Forest.  The community rests on U.S. Route 61. Arkansas Highway 171: Highway 171 (AR 171, Ark. 171, and Hwy.  171) is a designation for three state highways in Southwest Arkansas.

Upon reviewing the context, it appears that the Abbey of Saint-Étienne was founded by William the Conqueror.","I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. Upon reviewing the context, it is clear that the Abbey of Saint-Étienne was founded by William the Conqueror.","William the Conqueror: William I (c. 1028 – 9 September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard, was the first Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087.  A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as Duke William II) from 1035 onward.  After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later.  The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. Bassac Abbey: Bassac Abbey (French: ""Abbaye Saint-Étienne de Bassac"" ) is an 11th-century Romanesque style abbey in Bassac, Charente and part of the Ancient Diocese of Saintes .  The church was founded in 1002 by Wardrade Loriches, count of la Marche and first known Lord of Jarnac.  It was built to 1015 by Angel de Grimoard, Bishop of Angoulême, and his brother Iso, Bishop of Saintes.  In 1095 it was made subservient to the Abbey of Saint-Jean-D'Angely by Pope Urban II; it regained its independence in 1246.  Bassac Abbey was largely reconstructed under Guillaume de Vibrac, Abbot from 1247 to 1286. Abbey of Saint Gall: The Abbey of Saint Gall (German: Abtei St. Gallen ) is a dissolved abbey (747–1805) in a Roman Catholic religious complex in the city of St. Gallen in Switzerland.  The Carolingian-era monastery has existed since 719 and became an independent principality between 9th and 13th centuries, and was for many centuries one of the chief Benedictine abbeys in Europe.  It was founded by Saint Othmar on the spot where Saint Gall had erected his hermitage.  The library at the Abbey is one of the richest medieval libraries in the world.  The city of St. Gallen originated as an adjoining settlement of the abbey.  Following the secularization of the abbey around 1800 the former Abbey church became a Cathedral in 1848.  Since 1983 the whole remaining abbey precinct has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site. AS Saint-Étienne: Association Sportive de Saint-Étienne Loire (] ; commonly known as AS Saint-Étienne, ASSE, or simply Saint-Étienne) is a French association football club based in Saint-Étienne.  The club was founded in 1933 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the top division of French football.  Saint-Étienne plays its home matches at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.  The team is managed by Óscar García and captained by Loïc Perrin, who started his career at the club in 1996.  Saint-Étienne is known as ""Les Verts"" meaning ""the Greens"" due to its home colours. Vauluisant Abbey: Vauluisant Abbey, near Courgenay in the canton of Brienon-sur-Armançon, Yonne, France, is a Cistercian abbey founded in 1127 by a group of monks from the abbey of Preuilly (Seine-et-Marne) who came to settle between the forest of Othe and the forest of Lancy, an area near the borders of Ile-de-France, Champagne and Burgundy that had come to be far from human habitation.  They diverted the waters of the little River Alain and by 1 April 1129, works were far enough advanced for Henri Sanglier, the archbishop of Sens, to consecrate the modest oratory.  By 1140 Vauluisant was fully operational.  The abbey church was consecrated in 1149.  In the second half of the 12th century, granges were established to cultivate abbey lands far from the abbey itself, at Beauvais, Toucheboeuf, Livanne, Cérilly, Armentières, worked by lay brothers who lived communally.  Ironworks were established, fuelled by the dense woodlands, and tileworks, whose kilns were also fired by forest timber.  The energetic Cistercians of Vauluisant produced more than the abbey needed; the surplus was sold in the market towns of Troyes and Provins, where the abbots retained domiciles, and at the cathedral town of Sens. Leicester Abbey: The Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis, more commonly known as Leicester Abbey, was an Augustinian religious house in the city of Leicester, in the English Midlands.  The abbey was founded in the 12th century by the Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and grew to become the wealthiest religious establishment within Leicestershire.  Through patronage and donations the abbey gained the advowsons of countless churches throughout England, and acquired a considerable amount of land, and several manorial lordships.  Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell (a small dependent daughter house) at Cockerham Priory, in Lancashire.  The Abbey's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope.  These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock.  Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates.  The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts. AS Saint-Étienne (women): Association Sportive de Saint-Étienne Loire Féminin (] , commonly known as AS Saint-Étienne) is a French football club based in Saint-Étienne which plays in D1 Féminine.  The club is the women's side of the French football club of the same name and was founded in 1977 under the name Racing Club de Saint-Étienne.  The current name was adopted following the 2008–09 season as the club RC Saint-Étienne merged with their men's side. Abbot of Melrose: The Abbot and then Commendator of Melrose was the head of the monastic community of Melrose Abbey, in Melrose in the Borders region of Scotland.  The abbots of the earlier Northumbrian foundation from Lindisfarne are not included here.  The second abbey was founded in 1136 on the patronage of David I (""Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim""), King of Scots, by Cistercian monks from Rievaulx Abbey, Yorkshire.  Control of the abbey was secularized in the 16th century and after the accession of James Stewart, the abbey was held by commendators.  The last commendator, James Douglas of Lochleven, resigned the abbacy to William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton (his nephew) in December 1606, and the abbey itself to the king in 1608.  The abbey (or most of its lands) was then erected into a secular lordship for viscount Haddington, John Ramsay, who in 1609 was created ""Lord Melrose"".  Lochleven however resumed the title of commendator in 1613 until his death in 1620. Saint-Étienne Mine Museum: The ""Saint-Étienne Mine Museum"" is a French museum founded in 1991 in the city of Saint-Étienne in the French department of the Loire situated in the Rhône-Alpes region.  The site is registered as an historical monument since 2011 Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen: The Abbey of Saint-Étienne, also known as Abbaye aux Hommes (""Men's Abbey"") by contrast with the Abbaye aux Dames (""Ladies' Abbey""), is a former Benedictine monastery in the French city of Caen, Normandy, dedicated to Saint Stephen.  It was founded in 1063 by William the Conqueror and is one of the most important Romanesque buildings in Normandy.

What type of vegetation does Cerastium and Pavonia have in common?,Cerastium and Pavonia both have the common vegetation type of flowering plants.,"Annual, winter annual, or perennial plants",Open habitat,"I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. After reviewing the context again, it appears that Cerastium and Pavonia do not have a specific type of vegetation in common. Cerastium is a genus of plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae, while Pavonia is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These two genera do not share a specific vegetation type or ecological niche.","Cerastium and Pavonia both belong to the category of annual, winter annual, or perennial plants.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Upon reviewing the provided context, it seems that Cerastium and Pavonia do not have a specific type of vegetation in common. The context mentions that Cerastium is a genus of plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae, while Pavonia is a genus of plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. Each genus consists of various species that may have different habitats and characteristics. Therefore, there is no specific type of vegetation that can be attributed to both Cerastium and Pavonia.","Vegetation classification: Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. Vegetation and slope stability: Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots. Pavonia (plant): Pavonia is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.  The generic name honours Spanish botanist José Antonio Pavón Jiménez (1754–1844).  Several species are known as swampmallows. Desert riparian: Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (""Populus fremontii""), Arizona ash (""Fraxinus velutina""), arroyo willow (""Salix lasiolepis""), Goodding's willow (""Salix gooddingii""), red willow (""Salix laevigata""), California fan palm (""Washingtonia filifera""), and invasive species such as salt cedar (""Tamarix ramosissima""), giant reed (""Arundo donax""), and Russian olive (""Elaeagnus angustifolia"").  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees. Cerastium: Cerastium is a genus of annual, winter annual, or perennial plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.  They are commonly called mouse-ear chickweed.  Species are found nearly worldwide but the greatest concentration is in the northern temperate regions.  There are about 200 species.  A number are common weeds in fields and on disturbed ground. Tigridia: Tigridia , the peacock flowers, tiger-flowers or shell flowers, is a genus of bulbous or cormous plants, belonging to the family Iridaceae.  They have large showy flowers and one species, ""Tigridia pavonia"", is often cultivated for this.  The approximately thirty five species in this family grow in the Western Hemisphere, from Mexico to Chile.  The tigridia flower is short lived, each often blooming for only one day, but often several flowers will bloom from the same stalk.  Usually they are dormant during the winter dry-season.  Its roots are edible and were eaten by the Aztecs of Mexico who called it ""cacomitl"" and its flower ""ocēlōxōchitl"" ""Jaguar flower"".  The genus name means ""tiger-like"" and alludes to the coloration and spotting of the flowers of the type species ""Tigridia pavonia"". Pavonia lasiopetala: Pavonia lasiopetala is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family known by the common names that include Texas swamp-mallow, Wright pavonia, and rock rose.  It is native to Texas in the United States and Coahuila and Nuevo León in Mexico. British NVC community OV6: British NVC community OV6 (""Cerastium glomeratum"" - ""Fumaria muralis"" ssp.  ""boraei"" community) is one of the open habitat communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system.  It is one of six arable weed and track-side communities of light, less-fertile acid soils. Caatinga: Caatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).  It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.  The name ""Caatinga"" is a Tupi word meaning ""white forest"" or ""white vegetation"" (""caa"" = forest, vegetation, ""tinga"" = white). Wildfire: A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.  Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.

Upon reviewing the context provided, the American engineer and former astronaut aboard Apollo 11 who inspired the musical ""Moon Landing"" is Buzz Aldrin.","Based on the given context, the American engineer and former astronaut aboard Apollo 11, who inspired the musical Moon Landing, is Buzz Aldrin.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Based on the provided context, the American engineer and former astronaut aboard Apollo 11, who inspired the musical ""Moon Landing,"" is Buzz Aldrin. Buzz Aldrin served as the Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 11 mission and was one of the first two humans to land on the Moon.","Buzz Aldrin: Buzz Aldrin (born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American engineer and former astronaut.  As the Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 11, he was one of the first two humans to land on the Moon, and the second person to walk on it.  He set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), following mission commander Neil Armstrong.  He is a former U.S. Air Force officer with the Command Pilot rating.  He also went into orbit on the Gemini 12 mission, finally achieving the goals for EVA (space-walk work) that paved the way to the Moon and success for the Gemini program; he spent over five hours on EVA on that mission. Lunar plaque: Stainless steel commemorative plaques measuring 9 by were attached to the ladders on the descent stages of the United States Apollo Lunar Modules flown on lunar landing missions Apollo 11 through Apollo 17, to be left permanently on the lunar surface.  The plaques were originally suggested and designed by NASA's head of technical services Jack Kinzler, who oversaw their production.  All of the plaques bear facsimiles of the participating astronauts' signatures.  For this reason, an extra plaque had to be made for Apollo 13 due to the late replacement of one crewmember.  The first (Apollo 11) and last (Apollo 17) plaques bear a facsimile of the signature of Richard Nixon, President of the United States during the landings, along with references to the start and ""completion"" of ""man's"" ""first"" explorations of the Moon and expressions of peace for ""all mankind"".  All, except the Apollo 12 plaque (which is also textured differently), bear pictures of the two hemispheres of Earth.  Apollo 17's plaque bears a depiction of the lunar globe in addition to the Earth.  The plaques used on missions 13 through 16 bear the call-sign of each mission's Lunar Module.  All the plaques were left on the Moon, except the two for the aborted Apollo 13 which did not land on the Moon. Apollo 13 (film): Apollo 13 is a 1995 American space adventure docudrama film directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris.  The screenplay by William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert, that dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission, is an adaptation of the book ""Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13"" by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.  The film depicts astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission.  En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely. Canceled Apollo missions: Several planned missions of the Apollo manned Moon landing program of the 1960s and 1970s were canceled for a variety of reasons, including changes in technical direction, the Apollo 1 fire, hardware delays, and budget limitations.  Immediately after the program achieved its primary objective in July 1969 with Apollo 11 to land men on the Moon and return them safely, nine more landing missions were planned, but the last three, Apollo 18, 19 and 20, were canceled. Apollo 21: ""Apollo 21"" is an apocryphal reference to an eleventh manned Moon landing mission of NASA's Apollo program.  Apollo contracted for the construction of fifteen Saturn V launch vehicles used to launch the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon, and achieved the first manned landing with the sixth one (Apollo 11), leaving nine for follow-on lunar missions, through Apollo 20.  However, budget cuts caused NASA to cancel the last three missions, ending the lunar program after Apollo 17.  One Saturn V was used to launch the Skylab space station, and parts of the other two became museum displays. Moon Landing (music drama): Moon Landing is a musical with book, lyrics and music by Stephen Edwards.  The story, from an original idea and synopsis by Justin Fleming, is based on the American Space Race and the Apollo 11 spaceflight which on July 20, 1969 landed the first humans on the Moon and is seen through the eyes of Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. Alan Bean: Alan LaVern Bean (born March 15, 1932), (CAPT, USN, Ret.) , is an American former naval officer and Naval Aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut; he was the fourth person to walk on the Moon.  He was selected to become an astronaut by NASA in 1963 as part of Astronaut Group 3.  He made his first flight into space aboard Apollo 12, the second manned mission to land on the Moon, at the age of thirty-seven years in November 1969.  He made his second and final flight into space on the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, the second manned mission to the Skylab space station.  After retiring from the United States Navy in 1975 and NASA in 1981, he pursued his interest in painting, depicting various space-related scenes and documenting his own experiences in space as well as that of his fellow Apollo program astronauts. Soviet crewed lunar programs: The Soviet crewed lunar programs were a series of unsuccessful programs pursued by the Soviet Union to land a man on the Moon, in competition with the United States Apollo program to achieve the same goal set publicly by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961.  The Soviet government publicly denied participating in such a competition, but secretly pursued two programs in the 1960s: crewed lunar flyby missions using Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond) spacecraft launched with the Proton-K rocket, and a crewed lunar landing using Soyuz 7K-LOK and LK Lander spacecraft launched with the N1 rocket.  Following the dual American successes of the first crewed lunar orbit on December 24–25, 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end.  The Proton-based Zond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1 / L3 program was terminated de facto in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976.  Details of both Soviet programs were kept secret until 1990 when the government allowed them to be published under the policy of ""glasnost"". First on the Moon (1970 book): First on the Moon: A Voyage with Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (ISBN  ) is a book by the crew of the Apollo 11 Moon landing (Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin) in collaboration with Gene Farmer and Dora Jane Hamblin, first published in 1970.  It describes the events leading up to and during the Apollo 11 mission, the first manned landing on the Moon.  It was first published in June 1970 by Little, Brown and Company. Apollo 10: Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, and the second (after Apollo 8) to orbit the Moon.  Launched on May 18, 1969, it was the F mission: a ""dress rehearsal"" for the first Moon landing, testing all of the components and procedures, just short of actually landing.  The Lunar Module (LM) followed a descent orbit to within 8.4 nmi of the lunar surface, at the point where powered descent for landing would normally begin.  Its success enabled the first landing to be attempted on the Apollo 11 mission two months later.
