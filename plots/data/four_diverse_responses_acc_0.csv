Where did the form of music played by Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt originate?,"Hessen, Germany.",Germany.,Germany,"Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt originated in Eichenzell-Lütter in Hessen, Germany.","Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt originated in Eichenzell-Lütter, Hessen, Germany.","Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt originated in Eichenzell-Lütter, Germany.","Pantun Sunda: Pantun Sunda is a type of Sundanese oral narrative performance interspersed with songs and music played on a ""kacapi"", a kind of zither.  A pantun is intended to be recited during an evening-length performance during which a single performer relates the story of a hero’s initiation: The protagonist leaves his kingdom in order to seek experiences, beautiful princesses to become his wife, power, other kingdoms to subject, the realization of a dream (Rosidi 1984a:143); after having succeeded in reaching his goal he finally returns to his kingdom.  Alongside descriptions of historical events, the stories often contain mythical elements.  Pantun were originally not written down, the bards often being illiterate and in many cases blind.  Originally the performances had a sacred character, as was clear from the offerings made at the beginning of the recitation and also from the content of the introductory part of the story, called rajah, which was an invocatory song, imploring the help of divine figures to ward off bad influences.  The linguistic form of the pantun was not strictly fixed, however the dominant form employed in most pantun is the octosyllabic verse.  For a detailed description of the nature and form of a Sundanese pantun you are referred to Eringa (1949), to Hermansoemantri (1977–79). Bubu music: Bubu music is traditional music played by the Temne people in Sierra Leone.

It is the name of the first piece of music played during a group performance called a fasıl (] ).  It also serves as the penultimate piece of the ""Mevlevi ayini"", ritual music of the Mevlevi order, under the name ""son peşrev"" (final peşrev), preceding ""son semai"".  It usually uses long rhythm cycles, stretching over many measures as opposed to the simpler usul the other major form of instrumental music uses, ""saz semai"". Skiffle: Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using a combination of manufactured and homemade or improvised instruments.  Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt.  Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. Cachi Cachi music: Cachi Cachi music, also spelled Kachi Kachi, Kachi-Kachi and Katchi-Katchi, is a term that was coined to refer to music played by Puerto Ricans in Hawaii, when they migrated to Hawaii.  It is a ""variation of dance music found in Hawaii"".  Sometimes cachi cachi ""involves fast, improvised solos"" on the guitar.  The ""influence on Hawai'i endures to this day in the musical form known as ""cachi cachi"" played on the quarto [sic] and derivative of the Puerto Rican jibaro style.""  ""Jibaro"" means peasant in Spanish. Background music: Background music refers to various styles of music or soundscapes primarily intended to be passively listened to.  It is not meant to be the main focus of an audience, but rather to supplement that which is meant to be focused upon.  Music that is played at a low volume and is not the main focus of an audience is also referred to as background music.  Traditional examples of background music include music played at various social gatherings and music played in certain retail venues.  It is also common to employ background music in various electronic media including film, television, video games, and Internet videos such as video blogs. Kantrum: Kantrum (Thai กันตรึม) is a type of folk music played by the Khmer in Isan, Thailand, living near the border with Cambodia.  It is a fast, traditional dance music.  In its purest form, cho-kantrum, singers, percussion and fiddles dominate the sound.  A more modern form using electric instrumentation arose in the mid-1980s. Chillador: A chillador is a very small guitar-shaped fretted stringed instrument, usually with 10, 12, or 14 metal strings, in paired or tripled courses.It is played in Peru and in some border areas in Bolivia, usually has 5 courses like its cousin, the charango.  The sort of music played on chillador it is very much like the music played on charango.  The main difference between charango and chillador is that the charango soundbox is made of an armadillo shell while the chillador is just a little guitar. Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt: Die Rhöner Säuwäntzt are a Skiffle-Bluesband from Eichenzell-Lütter in Hessen, Germany.

Minoru Kojima: Minoru Kojima (born 11 October 1968) was the original guitarist for Japanese experimental punk band The Mad Capsule Markets.  He is also known as Scene or Shin Murohime, which is apparently a conglomeration of characters from the names of different Boøwy members.  He started The Mad Capsule Markets (which at the time was called Berrie) in 1985, with vocalist Hiroshi Kyono, in an attempt to create ""loud, punk music"" after becoming ""bored"" with music played on television and radio.  After the release of Mad's Noël Coward ""Humanity"", Minoru left the band and was replaced by ""support guitarist"" Ai Ishigaki.  In 1991 Minoru started Die in Cries and in 1994 became a member of The Bloody Imitation Society.  Over the years Minoru worked with more bands and even went solo for a short time before returning to Mad to play on ""Good Day"" from their album ""010"" and playing on their ""Cistm Konfliqt"" tour.

In 2004-2005 he replaced Frank Bello in Anthrax as the band's bassist, but did not record with them.  He was also a member of Engine, recorded with Tribe After Tribe, and appears on the OSI album ""Free"".  His first solo album, ""A Thousand Faces"", was released in 1994.  His current solo project, A Chinese Firedrill, released an album titled ""Circles"" in 2007. Hurt Locker (musical): Hurt Locker The Musical is a fictional musical in the 2014 Broadway premiere production of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"".  In the Broadway performance of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" the musical opens with Hedwig explaining that the musical only ran for a single night before closing during intermission, and that she has convinced a producer to let her perform in what would otherwise be an empty stage.  Fake Playbills for the musical are used as props and are found scattered on the floor of the Belasco Theatre and contains advertisements for other fake musicals based on feature films such as ""Gravity on Ice"", ""Container Store: The Musical"", ""The Entire Bible"", and ""SoulCycle on Broadway"".  The Playbills, which describe the musical as having ""explosions, negligible storytelling, camouflage and tits"", also state that the musical's cast included actors such as Taye Diggs (who would go on to play the role of Hedwig in the summer of 2015) and that the music was written by Metallica and Stephen R. Schwartz, which is the real name of ""Hedwig"" songwriter Stephen Trask. Obús: Obús is a Spanish heavy metal band created in Madrid in the early 80s.  They stood out because they took the risk of making a big spectacle in their concerts in order to reach to the level of other international heavy metal bands.  In addition, the lyrics they write and the feelings they transmit connect with the people that follow them.  As they said in an interview: ""All our songs , some more and some less, have a meaning"".  Far away from renouncing to their genre, they have always claimed that they were a heavy metal band and they even wrote a song about this genre in their first LP called""Dosis de Heavy Metal"". In 2012, because of their 30th anniversary, they did a Tour around Spain. Metal Health: Metal Health is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Quiet Riot.  It was released on March 11, 1983, bolstered by the No. 5 hit ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and the No. 31 hit ""Metal Health"".  ""Metal Health"" is notable for being the first heavy metal album to reach the top spot on the ""Billboard"" 200, replacing the Police's ""Synchronicity"" at number one in November 1983.  The album went on to sell more than six million copies and is considered a classic among heavy metal fans.  Some critics, such as AllMusic, describe it as a one-hit wonder, owing to Quiet Riot's relative lack of critical and commercial success with following albums (and subsequent disintegration) towards the end of the 1980s.  The title track was ranked No. 35 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.

Nu metal rarely features guitar solos; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs.  Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound.

Where is the company that purchased Aixam based in?,US,US,US,The company that purchased Aixam is based in the United States.,"The company that purchased Aixam, Polaris Industries, is based in Roseau, Minnesota, USA.","The company that purchased Aixam, Polaris Industries, is based in the United States.","WizKids: WizKids/NECA, LLC is an American company based in New Jersey that first made its mark in the game industry producing collectible miniatures wargames.  WizKids was purchased by and is a subsidiary of National Entertainment Collectibles Association.  The company was founded in 2000 by Jordan Weisman, a veteran of the game company FASA.  It was purchased by sports-card manufacturer Topps, Inc. in 2003.  (Topps was, in turn, acquired by Michael Eisner's Tornante Company and Madison Dearborn Partners in 2007.) Aixam: Aixam-Mega is a French automobile manufacturer based in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie.  It was founded in 1983 to make microcars following the acquisition of Arola.  On April 11, 2013, US based Polaris Industries announced that it had acquired Aixam-Mega. Arola (microcar): Arola SARL was a small manufacturing company based in Lyon-Corbas, France, which manufactured a range of microcars, designed to be driven without a licence.  Arola became part of the Aixam group in 1983. Knapp, Stout &amp; Co.: Knapp, Stout & Co. was a lumber company based in Menomonie, Wisconsin in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  The company was established in 1846, when John Holly Knapp and William Wilson purchased half of interest in a lumber mill on the Red Cedar River from David Black; it was originally known as Black & Knapp.  Later Andrew Tainter acquired a quarter-interest, and the company has become Knapp-Tainter Lumber Company.  Henry Stout bought a quarter interest in the company in 1853, and its name became Knapp, Stout & Company.  The company's location allowed it to control the lumber industry in the region, and by 1870 it controlled the logging industry in the Red Cedar River valley.  In 1878, the company incorporated, and its official name became the Knapp, Stout & Co., Company.  The company employed over 2,000 workers in the Menomonie area and produced 85 million board feet of lumber on average yearly from 1871 to 1896; its output made it the largest lumber company in the world.  In the 1880s, the company expanded to sites along the Mississippi River, opening offices in Dubuque, Iowa, Read's Landing, Minnesota, and St. Louis.  By the 1900s, the company had largely depleted its lumber supply; it closed many of its camps and dissolved early in the 20th century.  The company sent out its last shipment of lumber on August 12, 1901. Syncros: Syncros is a brand of bicycle components, with an emphasis on off-road bicycle parts.  Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Syncros had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts.  In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S. based bicycle company GT.  Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts.  Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the Syncros brand name, and used the Syncros label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation.  Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the Syncros brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham.  However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name. Murco Petroleum: Murco Petroleum Ltd is a United Kingdom based oil refining company.  It was set up by Murphy Oil Corporation in 1960.  The company owns a forecourt based chain of Costcutter convenience stores.  In 1981, Murco purchased an 30% stake in Amoco's Milford Haven Refinery, and in 2007, they purchased the remaining 70%. I. G. Baker Company: The I. G. Baker Company was a mercantile and grocery company based in Fort Benton, Montana, started by Isaac Gilbert Baker and his brother, George Amos Baker, as I. G. Baker & Brother in 1866.  After the Conrad brothers (Charles E. & Wm. G.) were admitted as partners in 1873, the company name was changed to I. G. Baker & Co., which name was retained after the Conrads purchased George Baker’s interest in 1874.  In 1891, the Canadian assets of the company were purchased by its chief rival there, the Hudson's Bay Company. Cliché Skateboards: Cliché Skateboards was a skateboard company based in Lyon, France and distributed by the American company Dwindle Distribution.  The company was established in 1997 by French professional skateboarder Jeremie Daclin.  In 2001, Cliché was purchased by the France-based Salomon Group which in 2005 became a part of Amer Sports.  In 2009, US-based Dwindle Distribution purchased the company from the Salomon Group.  In November 2016, Dwindle announced that they would be discontinuing the brand. Budd Silverliner: The Budd Silverliner a model of Electric Multiple Unit railcar was designed and built by the Budd Company with 59 examples being delivered starting in 1963.  55 of the cars were purchased for the Reading and Pennsylvania Railroads with public funds for use in Philadelphia, PA area commuter rail service with the remaining 4 cars being purchased by USDOT for use in high-speed rail experiments in 1965.  Based on a series of 6 prototype Pioneer III cars built in 1958, the Silverliners represented the first production order of ""modern"" commuter MU equipment purchased by either railroad and earned their name from their unpainted stainless steel construction which contrasted with the painted carbon steel bodies of the pre-war MU fleets.  The cars became a fixture of SEPTA Regional Rail service providing the name to their entire series of EMU railcars before finally being retired in 2012 after 49 years in service.

Timeline of town creation in the Hudson Valley: The towns and cities of the Hudson Valley were created by the U.S. state of New York as municipalities, in order to perform the services of local government.  In 1683, prior to the creation of modern towns, the Province of New York was divided into twelve counties for administrative purposes by the Colonial Governor of New York.  In the Hudson Valley, these divisions included Dutchess, Orange, and Ulster counties.  Dutchess and Orange remained unorganized until 1713, with Dutchess administered from Ulster; Orange would be administered from New York County.  Future counties would be formed and towns exchanged over time, with Rockland County split from Orange in 1799, at which time the southern towns of Ulster were transferred to Orange as compensation for the loss; and Putnam County from Dutchess in 1812, these county's towns can trace their origins to towns and precincts that were formed in their parent counties.  Another change that occurred was the transfer of Dutchess County's northern section, the Livingston Manor, to Columbia County.  Greene County was formed in 1800 by the combination of the southernmost towns of Albany County with the northernmost towns of Ulster.  The history of the towns of Greene and Columbia counties can be found at the Timeline of town creation in New York's Capital District.

Which industry do Richard Hawley and Chicago's Catherine belong to? ,Music,Music,Music,Richard Hawley and Chicago's Catherine belong to the music industry.,Richard Hawley and Chicago's Catherine both belong to the music industry.,Richard Hawley and Chicago's Catherine belong to the music industry.,"Late Night Final: Late Night Final is the second studio album (and first full-length album after the mini-album ""Richard Hawley"" released six months earlier) from musician Richard Hawley, released in the UK in October 2001 by Setanta Records.  Named after the cry of vendors selling the ""Sheffield Star"" evening newspaper on the streets of his home city, it was released to positive reviews.  A single, ""Baby, You're My Light"" was released from the album in February 2002, reaching #81 in the UK singles chart. Lady's Bridge (album): Lady's Bridge is the fifth studio album from musician Richard Hawley, released on 20 August 2007 in the UK and on 9 October 2007 in the US.  The album follows his 2005 Mercury Music Prize-nominated album ""Coles Corner"".  It is named after the landmark location of Lady's Bridge in Hawley's hometown of Sheffield, an old bridge over the River Don that historically connected the rich and poor parts of the town.  Hawley told ""Uncut"" magazine that ""the title is a metaphor too; it's about leaving the past behind"".  The cover features a photograph, taken by Martin Parr, of Hawley and his guitar at the Club 60 music venue in Sheffield as a tribute to his father Dave who had died of lung cancer earlier that year: Dave Hawley had been a blues guitarist at the club in his youth, playing alongside Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. Standing at the Sky's Edge: Standing at the Sky's Edge is the seventh studio album from English musician Richard Hawley, released in the UK on 7 May 2012 and in the US on 28 August 2012.  The album is markedly different from Hawley's previous efforts, often relinquishing softer instrumentation in favour of squalling guitars.  As with all of Hawley's previous albums, the title obliquely refers to a location in his native city of Sheffield, in this case Skye Edge, a hillside area with views over the city centre and formerly known for its crime-ridden estates but largely redeveloped in the mid-2000s. Richard Hawley: Richard Willis Hawley (born 17 January 1967) is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and producer.  After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s.  After that group broke up in 2000, he later joined the band Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, for a short time.  As a solo musician, Hawley has released seven studio albums.  He has been nominated for a Mercury prize twice and once for a Brit Award.  He has collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley, Arctic Monkeys, Manic Street Preachers and Paul Weller. Catherine (alternative rock band): Catherine was an alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois that was active from 1985 to 1998.  They were signed to TVT Records. Truelove's Gutter: Truelove's Gutter is the sixth studio album from musician Richard Hawley, released on 21 September 2009 in the UK and on 22 September 2009 in the US.  The album title refers to an ancient street in Hawley's native Sheffield, now thought to be the location of present-day Castle Street, which was allegedly named after 18th-century innkeeper Thomas Truelove, who used charge local people to dump their rubbish in the gutter in the street that then flowed down to the River Don.  Thematically, ""Truelove's Gutter"" is Richard's darkest album to date.  Richard told the BBC that the album was inspired by particularly dark periods in his life and those of others.  The album features some uncommon instrumentation, such as the waterphone, megabass, and cristal baschet. Lowedges: Lowedges is the third studio album from musician Richard Hawley.  It was released in the UK in February 2003 by Setanta Records.  It is named after a district in Hawley's home city of Sheffield. A Heavy Nite With...: A Heavy Nite With... is the debut album by British band Relaxed Muscle fronted by Pulp's Jarvis Cocker, using the pseudonym Darren Spooner.  The other member is Jason Buckle.  It has been alleged that Jason Buckle is a pseudonym for Pulp guitarist Richard Hawley, but this is not the case - Hawley does contribute guitar to the album, however, under the pseudonym Wayne Marsden. Broken (Soulsavers album): Broken is the third full-length studio album from electronica production duo Soulsavers, released by V2 Records in the UK on 17 August 2009, and released by Columbia Records in the US in September as a digital download.  As with their 2007 album ""It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land"", a collaboration with Mark Lanegan and a host of guest vocalists, ""Broken"" once again features Lanegan as the primary vocalist, as well as contributions from Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy (Will Oldham), Jason Pierce (of Spiritualized and Spacemen 3), Mike Patton (of Faith No More), Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes (of Butthole Surfers).  The non-album single ""Sunrise"", a song written by Lanegan and sung by Will Oldham, preceded the album release on 3 August 2009.  The AA-side is a cover of Palace Brothers' ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"", written by Oldham and sung by Lanegan, that also features on the album. Longpigs: Longpigs were a British alternative rock band who rose to fame on the fringe of Britpop in the 1990s, comprising Crispin Hunt (vocals), Richard Hawley (guitar), Simon Stafford (bass guitar) and former Cabaret Voltaire member Dee Boyle (drums) who was replaced by Andy Cook for their second album.  Hailing from Sheffield, the group had success with singles such as ""She Said"", ""On and On"", and their well-received debut album ""The Sun Is Often Out"" (1996).

Are the New Orleans Outfall Canals the same length as the Augusta Canal?,No.,No.,No.,"Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. After reviewing the context, it is clear that the New Orleans Outfall Canals and the Augusta Canal are not the same length. The Augusta Canal is approximately 13 miles long, while the New Orleans Outfall Canals consist of three canals - the 17th Street Canal, Orleans Avenue Canal, and London Avenue Canal - and their combined length is not mentioned in the context.","I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. The length of the New Orleans Outfall Canals and the Augusta Canal is not specified in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if they are the same length.","Based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to determine whether the New Orleans Outfall Canals are the same length as the Augusta Canal. The length of the New Orleans Outfall Canals is not mentioned, and only the approximate length of the Augusta Canal (13 miles) is provided. Therefore, the answer remains inconclusive.","Augusta Canal: The Augusta Canal is a historic canal located in Augusta, Georgia, United States.  The canal is fed by the Savannah River and passes through three levels (approximately 13 miles total) in suburban and urban Augusta before the water returns to the river at various locations.  It was devised to harness the water power at the fall line of the Savannah River to drive mills, to provide transportation of goods, and to provide a municipal water supply.  It is the only canal in the US in continuous use for its original purposes of providing power, transport and municipal water. 17th Street Canal: The 17th Street Canal is the largest and most important drainage canal in the city of New Orleans.  Operating with Pump Station 6, It moves water into Lake Pontchartrain.  The canal, along with the Orleans Canal and the London Avenue Canal, form the New Orleans Outfall Canals.  The 17th Street Canal forms a significant portion of the boundary between the city of New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana.  The canal has also been known as the Metairie Outlet Canal and the Upperline Canal. Almonaster Road: Almonaster Avenue is a four-lane divided road in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, named after 18th-century Spanish philanthropist Don Andres Almonaster y Rojas.  It forms in the residential neighborhoods of the Upper Ninth Ward by branching off at a Y-type intersection with Franklin Avenue.  Shortly afterwards, the road elevates on an overpass to cross the Norfolk Southern Railway and returns to ground level as it crosses the Industrial Canal on the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, a bascule bridge that it shares with CSX Transportation, proceeding into New Orleans East.  The traffic lanes straddle the railroad bridge on either side; this is the only location where Almonaster becomes a two-lane road, albeit divided.  It is also the last of the combination railroad/automobile movable bridges.  It winds through the New Orleans Business and Industrial District (NO BID) parallel with the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.  It intersects with Interstate 510 before finally ending at the junction with U.S. Highway 90.  It is also known for New Orleans street racing. Karakum Canal: The Karakum Canal (Qaraqum Canal, Kara Kum Canal, Garagum Canal; Russian: Каракумский канал , ""Karakumsky Kanal"", Turkmen: Garagum kanaly , گَرَگوُم كَنَلیٛ, ""Гарагум каналы"") in Turkmenistan is one of the largest irrigation and water supply canals in the world.  Started in 1954, and completed in 1988, it is navigable over much of its 1375 km length, and carries 13 km3 of water annually from the Amu-Darya River across the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan.  The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water.  Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50 percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems.  The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster. New Orleans Outfall Canals: There are three outfall canals in New Orleans, Louisiana – the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals.  These canals are a critical element of New Orleans’ flood control system, serving as drainage conduits for much of the city.  There are 13 mi of levees and floodwalls that line the sides of the canals.  The 17th Street Canal is the largest and most important drainage canal and is capable of conveying more water than the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue Canals combined. London Avenue Canal: The London Avenue Canal is a drainage canal in New Orleans, Louisiana, used for pumping rain water into Lake Pontchartrain.  The Canal runs through the 7th Ward of New Orleans from the Gentilly area to the Lakefront.  It is one of the three main drainage canals responsible for draining rainwater from the main basin of the city of New Orleans.  The London Avenue Canal's flood walls built atop earthen levees breached on both sides during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Orleans Canal: The Orleans Canal is a drainage canal in New Orleans, Louisiana.  The canal, along with the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal, form the New Orleans Outfall Canals.  The current version of the canal is about 2 km long, running along the up-river side of City Park, through the Lakeview and Lakeshore neighborhood, and into Lake Pontchartrain.  It is part of the system used to pump rain water out of the streets of the city into the Lake.  The Canal has also been known as the Orleans Avenue Canal, the Orleans Outfall Canal, the Orleans Tail Race, and early on, the Girod Canal, Southern Railway Terminal (New Orleans): The Southern Railway Terminal, originally officially ""New Orleans Terminal"", in New Orleans was constructed by the Southern Railway in 1908 on the neutral ground of Basin Street at the intersection of Canal Street.  The building was designed by Daniel Burnham, who was also the architect for the Union Station in Washington D.C.  The station also served the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad and the New Orleans Terminal Company. 16th Ward of New Orleans: The 16th Ward or Sixteenth Ward is a division of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, one of the 17 Wards of New Orleans.  New Orleans Districts and Wards.  It is an Uptown ward, along with the adjacent 17th Ward formerly part of the city of Carrollton, Louisiana, annexed by New Orleans in the 1870s.  The Ward stretches inland from the Mississippi River, with the upper boundary being Carrollton Avenue, across which is the 17th Ward, and the lower being Lowerline Street, across which is the 14th Ward.  The back boundary was the New Basin Canal, now part of the route of I-10. Canal Streetcar Line: The Canal Streetcar line is a historic streetcar line in New Orleans, Louisiana.  It is operated by the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA).  It originally operated from 1861 to 1964.  It was redesigned and rebuilt between 2000 and 2004, and operation was reinstated in 2004 after a 40-year hiatus.  Primarily running along its namesake street, Canal Street, it consists of two branches named for their outer terminals, totaling about 5+1/2 mi in length: ""Canal - Cemeteries"" (officially designated as Route 47) and ""Canal - City Park/Museum"" (officially designated as Route 48).  Each branch is denoted with the red and light green colors respectively on most RTA publications.

Late in 1966, with the approach of the Centennial Year, an agreement was made between the Kings County Historical Society, the Municipality of Kings County, and the New Brunswick Centennial Administration to have space for a Museum in the new County Centennial Building in Hampton.  The official opening of the Kings County Museum was on June 1, 1968.

This has led to speculation that the Yarmouth, Nova Scotia area, in Canada, was visited by Viking explorers sometime around 1000 C.E.

The version of the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" in the ""Worcester Chronicle"" says that in 735 he succeeded Pehthelm, after the latter's death, as Bishop of Whithorn.  The only other source for Frithwald is the entry in versions D and E of the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" which, ""sub anno"" 762, relate that:Frithwald, bishop at Whithorn, died on the Nones of May [May 7].  He was consecrated at Chester on the eighteenth before the Kalends of September [August 15], in the sixth winter of Ceolwulf's kingship [734/5]; and he was bishop twenty-nine winters<br>""Friþuweald biscop æt Hwiterne forðferde on Nonas Maius, se wæs gehalgod on Ceastre on . xviii.  Kalendas September þam . vi.  wintra Ceolwulfes rices, 7 he wæs biscop . xxix.  wintra"".  If the Worcester source is correct, that would put his death in 764; the entry is also sometimes thought to cover the year 763. Kings of the Angles: The Angles were a dominant Germanic tribe in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, and gave their name to the English, England and to the region of East Anglia.  Originally from Angeln, present-day Schleswig-Holstein, a legendary list of their kings has been preserved in the heroic poems ""Widsith"" and ""Beowulf"", and the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"". The Dragon (Beowulf): The final act of the Anglo-Saxon poem ""Beowulf"" is about the hero Beowulf's fight with a dragon, the third monster he encounters in the epic.  On his return from Heorot, where he killed Grendel and Grendel's mother, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats and rules peacefully for fifty winters until a slave awakens and angers a dragon by stealing a jewelled cup from its lair in order to gain freedom from killing his brother.  When the angry dragon mercilessly burns the Geats' homes and lands, Beowulf decides to fight and kill the monster personally.  He and his thanes climb to the dragon's lair where, upon seeing the beast, the thanes flee in terror, leaving only Wiglaf to battle at Beowulf's side.  When the dragon wounds Beowulf fatally, Wiglaf slays it. Battle of Brunanburh (poem): The Battle of Brunanburh is an Old English poem.  It is preserved in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"", a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century.  The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons.  The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry.  The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex. Widsith: Widsith is an Old English poem of 143 lines.  The poem survives only in the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century containing approximately one sixth of all surviving Old English poetry.  Widsith is located between the poems ""Vainglory"" and ""The Fortunes of Men"".  Since the donation of the Exeter Book in 1076, it has been housed in Exeter Cathedral in southwest England.  The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the Heroic Age of Northern Europe: see Tribes of Widsith. Grendel: Grendel is a being originated from the Anglo-Saxon epic poem ""Beowulf"" (AD 700–1000), which is considered to be the oldest surviving poem in Old English.  He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with Grendel's mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf.  Grendel is feared by all but Beowulf.  Grendel is described to have descended from the lineage of the Biblical figure Cain, from Genesis 4 of the Bible, and is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant or some other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. Nowell Codex: The Nowell Codex is the second of two manuscripts found in the bound volume Cotton Vitellius A.xv, one of the four major Anglo-Saxon poetic manuscripts.  It is most famous as the manuscript containing the unique copy of the epic poem ""Beowulf"".  In addition to this, it contains first a fragment of ""The Life of Saint Christopher"", then the more complete texts ""Wonders of the East"" and ""Letters of Alexander to Aristotle,"" and, after ""Beowulf"", a poetic translation of ""Judith"".  Due to the fame of ""Beowulf"", the Nowell codex is also sometimes known simply as the Beowulf manuscript.  The manuscript is located within the British Library with the rest of the Cotton collection. Offa of Angel: Offa is a legendary king of the Angles in the genealogy of the kings of Mercia presented in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"".  He is the son of Wermund and the father of Angeltheow. History of Herefordshire: The History of Herefordshire starts with a shire in the time of Athelstan (895–939), and Herefordshire is mentioned in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" in 1051.  The first Anglo-Saxon settlers, the Magonsætan, were a sub-tribal unit of the Hwicce who occupied the Severn valley.  The Magonsætan were said to be in the intervening lands between the Rivers Wye and Severn.  The undulating hills of marl clay were surrounded by the Welsh mountains to the west; the Malvern Hills to the east; the Clent Hills of the Shropshire borders to the north, and the indeterminate extent of the Forest of Dean to the south.  The shire name first recorded in the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"" was derived from ""Here-ford"", Old English for ""Army crossing"", the location for the city.  The area was covered first by Offa of Mercia, who constructed the dyke as a boundary to keep warring tribes out of the Mercian kingdom: an early indication of the ambivalent relations with the Welsh.  The shire as an administrative unit was developed from Alfred the Great's Burghal Hidage, and the Shire-reeve courts of the Hundred.  King Edgar the Ætheling was a regular visitor, and founded the diocese, previously part of the see of Worcester, in 976.  The establishment of a centre of law and justice was supported by a monastic chapter that flourished during the Tenth century Reformation.  Hereford's geographical location at the hub of the shire allowed Anglo-Saxon ealdormen to manage affairs; and Hereford played a vital role in the Scandinavian wars until Ralph, Earl Hereford was deposed by the regal Earl Harold Godwinson. Layamon's Brut: Layamon's ""Brut (ca. 1190 - 1215), also known as The Chronicle of Britain"", is a Middle English poem compiled and recast by the English priest Layamon.  The ""Brut"" is 16,095 lines long and narrates the history of Britain: it is the first historiography written in English since the ""Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"".  Named for Britain's mythical founder, Brutus of Troy, the poem is largely based on the Anglo-Norman ""Roman de Brut"" by Wace, which is in turn a version of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin ""Historia Regum Britanniae"".  Layamon's poem, however, is longer than both and includes an enlarged section on the life and exploits of King Arthur.  It is written in the alliterative verse style commonly used in Middle English poetry by rhyming chroniclers, the two halves of the alliterative lines being often linked by rhyme as well as by alliteration.

Scientific journal: In academic publishing, a scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research.  Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists.  There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals).  Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as ""Nature"" publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.  Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity.  Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different.  Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine.  The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method.  If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results.  Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.

The criminal group came into existence during the rapid decentralization of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations and as a split-off group of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.  Originally, the Beltrán Leyva cartel operated in the city, but the group no longer has presence in Acapulco.  After the Mexican military gunned down the top boss of the cartel – Arturo Beltrán Leyva – in December 2009, his brother Héctor Beltrán Leyva took control of one of the factions of the cartel and declared war on Edgar Valdez Villarreal, who had long been the right hand of Arturo.  Amidst the violence, Valdez Villarreal tried to appoint a successor, but those in Acapulco broke off and formed their own criminal gang: the Independent Cartel of Acapulco.  Within weeks, however, the group had splittered too, forming a new and rival group known as La Barredora.  Villarreal Valdez was then captured by the Mexican Federal Police in August 2010, but the violence between the groups for the control of Acapulco continued. Edgar Valdez Villarreal: Edgar Valdez Villarreal (born August 11, 1973) also known as La Barbie (""The Barbie""), is a Mexican American suspected drug lord and leader of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, a criminal group based in Sinaloa.  He was arrested near Mexico City in August 2010 on charges related to large scale drug trafficking. United States declaration of war upon Bulgaria: On June 5, 1942, the United States Congress declared war upon Bulgaria.  Bulgaria was neutral during 1939-1941, but on March 1, 1941, Bulgaria signed the Tripartite Pact and officially joined the Axis bloc.  Following this, the Bulgarian government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on December 13, 1941.  The United States officially declared war on Bulgaria on June 5, 1942.  The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, and other Bulgarian cities, were bombed by Allied aircraft in 1943 and 1944. Italian declaration of war on the United States: On December 11, 1941, Italy declared war on the United States in response to that country's declaration of war upon the Empire of Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor four days earlier.  Germany also declared war on the U.S. the same day.  The US immediately responded by declaring war on Germany and Italy, thus thrusting the United States in fighting two major fronts across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in World War II. Tijuana Cartel: The Tijuana Cartel (Spanish: ""Cártel de Tijuana"") or Arellano-Félix Organization (Spanish: ""Cártel Arellano Félix - CAF"") is a Mexican drug cartel based in Tijuana.  The cartel once was described as ""one of the biggest and most violent criminal groups in Mexico.""  However, since the 2006 Sinaloa Cartel incursion in Baja California and the fall of the Arellano-Félix brothers, the Tijuana Cartel had been reduced to few cells.  In 2016, the organization has become known as Cartel Tijuana Nueva Generación (New Generation Tijuana Cartel) and has begun to aligin itself under the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, along with Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO) to create an anti-Sinaloa alliance, in which the Jalisco New Generation Cartel heads, creating a possible powershift in Mexico. Juárez Cartel: The Juárez Cartel (Spanish: ""Cártel de Juárez""), also known as the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization, is a Mexican drug cartel based in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, across the U.S.-Mexico border from El Paso, Texas.  The cartel is one of several drug trafficking organizations that have been known to decapitate their rivals, mutilate their corpses and dump them in public places to instill fear not only into the general public, but also into local law enforcement and their rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel.  The Juárez Cartel has an armed wing known as La Línea, a Juarez street gang that usually performs the executions.  It also uses the Barrio Azteca gang to attack its enemies. Undeclared war: An undeclared war is a military conflict between two or more nations without either side issuing a formal declaration of war.  The term is sometimes used to include any disagreement or conflict fought about without an official declaration.  Since the United Nations ""police action"" in Korea followed the example set by the United Kingdom during the so-called Malaysian Emergency, a number of democratic governments have pursued disciplinary actions and limited warfare by characterizing them as something else, such as a ""military action"" or ""armed response"".  The United States has not formally declared war since World War II.  Most notably, the United States never officially declared war during its more than decade-long involvement in Vietnam; the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution authorized the escalation of the Vietnam War without a declaration of war.  Nations such as France, which had extensive colonies in which its military provided order, continued to intervene in their former colonies' affairs as police actions. Independent Cartel of Acapulco: The Independent Cartel of Guerrero (Spanish: Cártel Independiente de Acapulco or CIDA) was a criminal gang based in the Mexican resort city of Acapulco, Guerrero and its surrounding territories.  The criminal group came into existence during the rapid decentralization of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations and as a split-off group of the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.  Originally, the Beltrán Leyva cartel operated in the city, but the group no longer has presence in Acapulco.  After the Mexican military gunned down the top boss of the cartel – Arturo Beltrán Leyva – in December 2009, his brother Héctor Beltrán Leyva took control of one of the factions of the cartel and declared war on Edgar Valdez Villarreal, who had long been the right hand of Arturo.

Villarreal Valdez was then captured by the Mexican Federal Police in August 2010, but the violence between the groups for the control of Acapulco continued. Murder of Lea Mek: Lea Mek (  1975 – December 3, 1993) was a Cambodian refugee living in the United States who was a member of the Asian Boyz street gang.  On December 3, 1993, Mek was murdered in a gang shooting by the Wah Ching gang, at a pool hall in El Monte, California.  The murder was caught on camera by four surveillance cameras installed within the hall.  After the murder, the Asian Boyz declared war on the Wah Ching.  As a result, it influenced a number of other gang murders and shootings in the LA area, and created a strong feud between both Asian gangs.  Authorities claim the murder inspired a chain reaction of gang violence which led to ten other murders in the LA area. Knights Templar Cartel: Knights Templar—Guard of Michoacán (Spanish: ""Los Caballeros Templarios Guardia Michoacana"") commonly known as the Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: ""Los Caballeros Templarios"") is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel based in the Mexican State of Michoacán.

Commission on Foreign Economic Policy: The U.S. President's Commission on Foreign Economic Policy (the Randall Commission) was established on August 7, 1953 by Public Law 215 entitled ""Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1953"" which extended the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 for one year.  On April 7, 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower requested that Congress extend for one year the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, a measure which had originally been passed in 1934.  Under this act and its subsequent extensions, the President was authorized to negotiate agreements with other countries for tariff reduction.  In his message of April 7, the President called for a commission to study U.S. foreign economic policy in general.  Section 301 of this Act provided for a bipartisan commission which consisted of seventeen members: seven appointed by the President, five appointed from the Senate by the Vice President, and five from the United States House of Representatives by the Speaker.  President Eisenhower appointed Clarence B. Randall, Chairman of the Board of Inland Steel Company, as Chairman of the Commission.  The Commission was directed to examine and report on the subjects of international trade, foreign economic policy, and the trade aspects of national security and total foreign policy.

He piloted the Gelatine airship on September 19, 1905.","Lowell Smith: Lowell Herbert Smith (October 8, 1892—November 4, 1945) was a pioneer American airman who piloted the first airplane to receive a complete mid-air refueling (along with Lt. John P. Richter) on June 27, 1923, and later set an endurance record of 37 hours on August 28, both in a De Havilland DH-4B.  Smith also piloted the Douglas World Cruiser ""Chicago"", which along with one other made the first aerial circumnavigation in 1924.  Smith held 16 records for military aircraft in speed, endurance and distance.  He was awarded the best achievement in flight Mackay Trophy twice. Lincoln J. Beachey: Lincoln J. Beachey (March 3, 1887 – March 14, 1915) was a pioneer American aviator and barnstormer.  He became famous and wealthy from flying exhibitions, staging aerial stunts, helping invent aerobatics, and setting aviation records. List of British airships: Airship development in the United Kingdom lagged behind that of Germany and France.  The first British designed and built airship was constructed by Stanley Spencer, and on 22 September 1902 was flown 30 mi from Crystal Palace, London to Ruislip, carrying an advertisement for baby food.  A series of more practical airships was constructed by Ernest Willows, the ""Willows Number 1"" making its first flight near Cardiff on 5 August 1905.  The Royal Navy realised that airships similar to Ferdinand von Zeppelin's designs could be of great use and in 1909 ordered construction of a rigid airship.  This was completed in 1911 but was wrecked while leaving the hangar before it had flown.  Meanwhile, the British Army's School of Ballooning, later the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, acquired a small fleet of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships for observation purposes; they were taken over by the Royal Navy on the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914.  A large number of rigid and non-rigid airships were mainly used to counter the U-Boat campaign in World War I.  Interest in military airships declined at the end of the war, but some success in the commercial field inspired the Imperial Airship Scheme; however, the disastrous crash of the R101 in 1930 ended serious government and commercial interest in airships.  Since the 1970s, there have been persistent efforts to revive a British airship industry, using new designs, materials and technologies. Zachary Lansdowne: Lieutenant Commander Zachary Lansdowne, USN (December 1, 1888 – September 3, 1925) was a United States Navy officer and early Naval aviator who contributed to the development of the Navy's first lighter-than-air craft.  He earned the Navy Cross for his participation in the first transoceanic airship flight while assigned to the British ""R34"" in 1919.  He later commanded the USS ""Shenandoah"" (ZR-1), which was the first rigid airship to complete a flight across North America.  He was killed in the crash of the ""Shenandoah"". Alys McKey Bryant: Alys McKey Bryant (1880–1954) was an American aviator.  She was the first woman to fly on the Pacific Coast and in Canada, and one of the few female members of the Early Birds of Aviation—individuals who had solo piloted an aircraft prior to December 17, 1916.  She cut short her brief career as a pilot after her husband, John Bryant, died while performing an air show in Victoria, Canada, in August 1913.  During World War I she trained pilots. Hilaire du Berrier: Hilaire du Berrier (1905 – October 12, 2002) was a pioneer American pilot, barnstormer, and spy. Santos-Dumont number 6: The Santos-Dumont No. 6 was an airship designed and built by the Brazilian pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont.  In 1901 it was used by him to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize for a return from Parc Saint Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back.  It is considered by many to be the first truly successful airship. Ernest Willows: Ernest Thompson Willows (1886–1926) was a pioneer Welsh aviator and airship builder.  He became the first person in the United Kingdom to hold a pilots certificate for an airship when the Royal Aero Club awarded him ""Airship Pilots Certificate No. 1"". Gelatine (airship): Gelatine was an airship operated by the United States Army Signal Corps.  ""Gelatine"" was built by Thomas Scott Baldwin's company Baldwin's Airships, Balloons, Aeroplanes of New York City.  On the morning of September 19, 1905, the ""Gelatine"", piloted by Lincoln J. Beachey, ascended from the grounds of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition on the shores of Guild's Lake in Portland, Oregon, landing 40 minutes later at the Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington.  The flight is considered as the first aerial crossing of the Columbia River and the first account of controlled powered flight in Washington. Douglas Campbell (aviator): Douglas Campbell (June 7, 1896 – December 16, 1990) was an American aviator and World War I flying ace.  He was the first American aviator flying in an American-trained air unit to achieve the status of ace.

Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera: Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera is an English musical with book, music, and lyrics by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall written for the Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol, England.  The show is based on a series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot, a New York City alley cat, a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake.  It had been intended for children, but when told by a New York City literary agent that “No mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the alley cat, never mind its name,” the story went into a drawer for many years.  It came out with the meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki, at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian's son Rupert Stanshall (born 1968), and later for his daughter with Ki, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall (born 1979).  In 1985 it “grew up” when Vivian and Ki decided to base a musical on its lead character, Stinkfoot.

A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2011, it was premiered on November 19, 2010, at Miller Theatre, Columbia University, by Karttunen and the Argento Chamber Ensemble. Kőműves Kelemen: Kőműves Kelemen (Bricklayer Kelemen) is a Hungarian folk tale about the building of the fortress of Deva.  Originating in the 16th century, its plot derived from a folk ballad.  There are several versions of this tale, with minor differences.  The eponymous poem makes reference to a well-known Hungarian folk tale in which the central character – a stonemason named Kőműves Kelemen – finds that the castle he’s trying to build keeps falling down, and is forced to sacrifice his beloved wife and mix her remains into the mortar in order to make the castle stand.  This is a reference familiar to almost any Hungarian reader, but clearly not obvious to the non-Hungarian. Stroma (musical group): Stroma is a mixed chamber ensemble based in Wellington, New Zealand.  It is New Zealand’s largest chamber ensemble, able to draw on over 20 players, many of whom are principal players with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO).

Dead Elvis (composition): Dead Elvis, also known as Develvis for Solo Bassoon and Chamber Ensemble (1993) by American composer Michael Daugherty, is a 10-minute, single-movement work inspired by the King of Rock-n-Roll, Elvis Presley.  ""Dead Elvis"" was commissioned by bassoonist Charles (Chuck) Ullery and The Grand Tetons Festival, and Richard Pittman/Boston Musica Viva.  The Chamber Ensemble instrumentation calls for solo bassoon, E flat clarinet, trumpet, bass trombone, violin, contrabass, and percussion.  The premiere was performed by The Grand Tetons Chamber Players, Michael Daugherty conducting and Charles Ullery as soloist, in July 1993. George Hurd: George Hurd is an American composer whose work focuses primarily on electroacoustic music combining classical instrumentation and electronics.  He has also written a substantial amount of music for solo electronics and classical chamber ensemble.  He is based in San Francisco, CA and heads The Hurd Ensemble, a chamber group dedicated to performing his pieces.  A large portion of his work is concert music for The Hurd Ensemble and other groups, and music for dance, most notably having collaborated with choreographer Loni Landon and LEVYdance on ""Meet Me Normal "" (2014) and ""the murmur of yearning"" for Kinetech Arts. John Bruce Yeh: John Bruce Yeh (born 1957) is an American clarinetist.  He has been the assistant principal clarinetist and E-flat clarinetist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra since 1977.

Uusinta Ensemble: Uusinta Ensemble is a Finnish chamber ensemble, focusing on contemporary music.  Until 2013, the ensemble was known as ""Uusinta Chamber Ensemble"", or ""Uusinta-kamariyhtye"" in Finnish.

The band has been considered highly influential for their progressive and inventive style of hardcore and rock.  When the band broke up in 2003, John LaRussa went on to form Inhale Exhale with Brian Pittman, a former member of Relient K.  John Pope joined Symphony In Peril briefly in 2003, and six months after he joined they disbanded.  There has been rumors of a reunion that's surfaced from time to time, but nothing official.  Mostly due to John LaRussa's busy schedule at times and refusal to play with the band again.

Initially conceived as a vehicle simply to prevent an existing historic collection of ancient synthesizers and Hammond organs from decaying through lack of use, the duo found interest from UK television company GMTV who used some of their early work as promo film soundtracks.  This led to a publishing contract with Taste Music, famously the erstwhile label of West Country progressive rock band, Muse.

Marshall was the founder and long-time head coach of the Detroit Heralds (renamed the Detroit Tigers in 1921) of the early National Football League.  Marshall, as a student at the University of Detroit, founded the Heralds in 1905, as an amateur team, after the university didn't field a team that year due to financial issues.  While the university's football team resumed play in 1906, the Heralds continued to play as an amateur team.  In 1911, the team dropped its amateur status and became semi-professional and left the campus.  The team would go on to regularly play teams from the ""Ohio League"", namely the Canton Bulldogs and Massillon Tigers.  In 1920, the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League in 1922) was established.  While the Heralds didn't officially join the association, they are listed in league standings for the season.  The Heralds, under Marshall, had a 1–3 record, while inclement weather eliminated their November schedule, financially devastating the team.  In 1921, the Heralds were reorganized into the Detroit Tigers.  Marshall remained the team's head coach, however financial issues caused that team to fold by year's end.

She was the cousin of the African-American composer and pianist Carl Rossini Diton and sister of the African-American composer and pianist John Harvey Hebron, Marian Anderson’s accompanist and piano teacher. Will Vodery: Will Vodery (October 8, 1885 - November 18, 1951) was an African-American composer, conductor, orchestrator, and arranger, and one of the few black Americans of his time to make a name for himself as a composer on Broadway, working largely for Florenz Ziegfeld. Scott Joplin: Scott Joplin ( ; 1867/68 or November 24, 1868– April 1, 1917) was an African-American composer and pianist.

Based on the context provided, Italo Calvino's best known work that is similar in genre to Richard Yates' ""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"" is the collection of Italian folktales titled ""Italian Folktales"" (""Fiabe italiane"").","The Paris Review: The Paris Review is a quarterly English language literary magazine established in Paris in 1953 by Harold L. Humes, Peter Matthiessen, and George Plimpton.  In its first five years, ""The Paris Review"" published works by Jack Kerouac, Philip Larkin, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Terry Southern, Adrienne Rich, Italo Calvino, Samuel Beckett, Nadine Gordimer, Jean Genet, and Robert Bly. Jesse Ball: Jesse Ball (born June 7, 1978) is an American novelist and poet.  He has published novels, volumes of poetry, short stories, and drawings.  His works are distinguished by the use of a spare style and have been compared to those of Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino. Italo Calvino: Italo Calvino (] ; 15 October 1923 – 19 September 1985) was an Italian journalist and writer of short stories and novels.  His best known works include the ""Our Ancestors"" trilogy (1952–1959), the ""Cosmicomics"" collection of short stories (1965), and the novels ""Invisible Cities"" (1972) and ""If on a winter's night a traveler"" (1979). Richard Yates (novelist): Richard Yates (February 3, 1926 – November 7, 1992) was an American fiction writer, identified with the mid-century ""Age of Anxiety"".  His first novel, ""Revolutionary Road"", was a finalist for the 1962 National Book Award.  His first short story collection, ""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"", brought comparisons to James Joyce.  His critical acclaim, however, was not reflected in commercial success during his lifetime, though interest in Yates has revived somewhat since his death, partly because of an influential 1999 essay by Stewart O'Nan in the Boston Review, a 2003 biography by Blake Bailey and the 2008 Academy Award-nominated and Golden Globe-winning film ""Revolutionary Road"", starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Eleven Kinds of Loneliness: Eleven Kinds of Loneliness is a collection of short stories written by Richard Yates from 1951 to 1961.  All of the stories in ""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"" also appeared in the posthumously released ""Collected Stories of Richard Yates"" (2001). You Make the Whole World Cry: ""You Make the Whole World Cry"" is the only single to be released from the album ""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"" by British musician Tanita Tikaram.  The record was issued on 10 February 1992 via East West Records label.  In 1996 the song was included in her album ""The Best of Tanita Tikaram"". Italian Folktales: Italian Folktales (""Fiabe italiane"") is a collection of 200 Italian folktales published in 1956 by Italo Calvino.  Calvino began the project in 1954, influenced by Vladimir Propp's ""Morphology of the Folktale""; his intention was to emulate the Straparola in producing a popular collection of Italian fairy tales for the general reader.  He did not compile tales from listeners, but made extensive use of the existing work of folklorists; he noted the source of each individual tale, but warned that was merely the version he used. Mr. Palomar: Mr. Palomar is a 1983 novel by the Italian writer Italo Calvino.  Its original Italian title is Palomar.  In an interview with Gregory Lucente, Calvino stated that he began writing ""Mr. Palomar"" in 1975, making it a predecessor to earlier published works such as ""If on a winter's night a traveler"".  ""Mr. Palomar"" was published in an English translation by William Weaver in 1985. Duluth (novel): Duluth is a 1983 novel by Gore Vidal.  He considered it one of his best works, as did Italo Calvino, who wrote, ""Vidal's development...along that line from ""Myra Breckinridge"" to ""Duluth"", is crowned with great success, not only for the density of comic effects, each one filled with meaning, not only for the craftsmanship in construction, put together like a clock-work which fears no word processor, but because this latest book holds its own built-in theory, that which the author calls 'après post-structuralism'.  I consider Vidal to be a master of that new form which is taking shape in world literature and which we may call the hyper-novel or the novel elevated to the square or the cube."" Richard Carrick: Richard David Carrick (born 1971 in Paris, France) is an American composer, pianist and conductor.

Hess House is a historic house on Arkansas Highway 14 in Marcella, Arkansas.  It is a two-story I-house, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, weatherboard siding, and stone foundation.  A two-story porch extends across the middle three bays of the north-facing front facade, with some jigsaw decorative work and turned balusters.  An ell extends to the rear, and the rear porch has been enclosed.  The house was built in 1900 by Thomas E. Hess, grandson of William Hess, the area's first white settler.  Other buildings on the property include a barn, stone cellar, and a log corn crib that was originally built as a schoolhouse. Dr. Thomas E. Lucas House: Dr. Thomas E. Lucas House is a historic home located at Chesterfield, Chesterfield County, South Carolina.  It was built about 1868, and is a two-story, three bay, central-hall plan, frame farmhouse, with a one-story rear wing.  It features a one-story porch across the front façade.  Also on the property is an antebellum smokehouse, a gazebo (originally used as a hothouse, c. 1885), and several other outbuildings.  The house is associated with Dr. Thomas E. Lucas, a farmer, physician and politician.  In 1864 Lucas resigned his position as a lieutenant in Company A in the Fifteenth Battalion, South Carolina Artillery, to serve in the South Carolina House of Representatives. New York State Thruway: The New York State Thruway, often called simply the Thruway, is a system of limited-access highways located within the state of New York in the United States.  The system, known officially as the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway for former New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, is operated by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) and comprises 569.83 mi of highway.  The tolled mainline of the Thruway extends for 496.00 mi from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley by way of Albany, Syracuse, and Buffalo.  According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Thruway is the fifth busiest toll road in the United States. Thomas E. O'Donnell: Thomas E. O'Donnell (1841 – c. 1875) was one of the driving forces in the New York City draft riots, when he was 22 years old.  He was a public opponent of the draft, so he was promptly arrested.  Though his jail time is unknown, it is known that he died at age 34 due to heart problems. Conscription in the United States: Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.

Based on the provided context, the journal ""Magnetic Resonance Imaging"" was established in 1982.","Elsevier: Elsevier (] ) is an information and analytics company and one of the world's major providers of scientific, technical, and medical information.  It was established in 1880 as a publishing company.  It is a part of the RELX Group, known until 2015 as Reed Elsevier.  Its products include journals such as ""The Lancet"" and ""Cell"", the ScienceDirect collection of electronic journals, the ""Trends"" and ""Current Opinion"" series of journals, the online citation database Scopus, and the ClinicalKey solution for clinicians.  Elsevier's products and services include the entire academic research lifecycle, including software and data-management, instruction and assessment tools. Magnetic resonance velocimetry: Magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) is an experimental method to obtain velocity fields in fluid mechanics.  MRV is based on the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance and adapts a medical magnetic resonance imaging system for the analysis of technical flows.  The velocities are usually obtained by phase contrast tomography techniques.  This means velocities are calculated from phase differences in the image data that has been produced using special gradient techniques.  MRV can be applied using common medical MRI scanners.  The term ""magnetic resonance velocimetry"" became current due to the increasing use of MR technology for the measurement of technical flows in engineering. Strain–encoded magnetic resonance imaging: Strain–encoded magnetic resonance imaging (SENC-MRI) is a magnetic resonance imaging a technique for imaging the strain of deforming tissue.  It is undergoing testing to diagnose some heart diseases, particularly congenital right ventricle dysfunctions, which are difficult to diagnose.  It is an improvement on magnetic resonance elastography in that it has a faster imaging time, and less post-processing time, to turn the acquired data into a useful image. Magnetic resonance neurography: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is the direct imaging of nerves in the body by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties of nerves.  It is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging.  This technique yields a detailed image of a nerve from the resonance signal that arises from in the nerve itself rather than from surrounding tissues or from fat in the nerve lining.  Because of the intraneural source of the image signal, the image provides a medically useful set of information about the internal state of the nerve such as the presence of irritation, nerve swelling (edema), compression, pinch or injury.  Standard magnetic resonance images can show the outline of some nerves in portions of their courses but do not show the intrinsic signal from nerve water.  Magnetic resonance neurography is used to evaluate major nerve compressions such as those affecting the sciatic nerve (e.g. piriformis syndrome), the brachial plexus nerves (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome), the pudendal nerve, or virtually any named nerve in the body.  A related technique for imaging neural tracts in the brain and spinal cord is called magnetic resonance tractography or diffusion tensor imaging. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), sometimes known as cardiac MRI, is a medical imaging technology for the non-invasive assessment of the function and structure of the cardiovascular system.  It is derived from and based on the same basic principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but with optimization for use in the cardiovascular system.  These optimizations are principally in the use of ECG gating and rapid imaging techniques or sequences.  By combining a variety of such techniques into protocols, key functional and morphological features of the cardiovascular system can be assessed. Fast low angle shot magnetic resonance imaging: Fast low angle shot magnetic resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) is a particular sequence of magnetic resonance imaging.  It is a gradient echo sequence which combines a low-flip angle radio-frequency excitation of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal (recorded as a spatially encoded gradient echo) with a rapid repetition time.  It is the generic form of steady-state free precession imaging. Nuclear magnetic resonance: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic radiation.  This energy is at a specific resonance frequency which depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the isotope of the atoms; in practical applications, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60–1000 MHz).  NMR allows the observation of specific quantum mechanical magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus.  Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (journal): Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Elsevier, encompassing biology, physics, and clinical science as they relate to the development and use of magnetic resonance imaging technology.  ""Magnetic Resonance Imaging"" was established in 1982 and the current editor-in-chief is John C. Gore.  The journal produces 10 issues per year. Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging: Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is a specific type of magnetic resonance imaging used primarily to determine flow velocities.  PC-MRI can be considered a method of Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry.  Since modern PC-MRI is typically time-resolved, it can also be referred to as 4D imaging (three spatial dimensions plus time). Seiji Ogawa: Seiji Ogawa (小川 誠二 ""Ogawa Seiji"", born January 19, 1934) is a Japanese researcher known for discovering the technique that underlies Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).  He is regarded as the father of modern functional brain imaging.  He determined that the changes in blood oxygen levels cause its magnetic resonance imaging properties to change, allowing a map of blood, and hence, functional, activity in the brain to be created.  This map reflected which neurons of the brain responded with electrochemical signals to mental processes.  He was the first scientist who demonstrated that the functional brain imaging is depended on the oxygenation status of the blood, the BOLD effect.  The technique was therefore called Blood oxygenation level-dependent or BOLD contrast.  Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to map the visual, auditory and sensory regions and moving toward higher brain functions such as cognitive functions in the brain.

This, the rockabilly band's second album, made a considerable impact on the Louisville music scene, finding a place at #80 on WFPK's ""top 1000 best albums ever"". "" Trouser Press"" asserted that the album reinforced ""Bodeco's simple genius by turning up the slop right from the get-go"". Sweatbees: Sweatbees is a compilation album by Louisville, Kentucky rock band My Morning Jacket.  It was released as a five-track EP in the UK on the Wichita label in 2002 and a nine-track compilation in Australia on the Spunk label in 2003.  On both versions it comprised tracks from the band's second album ""At Dawn"" and two EPs. Ricochet (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album): Ricochet is the second album, by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and their second album release of 1967, being released only four or five months after their first album, ""The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band"", which was released in February or March, 1967.  It appears that this album may have been released rather quickly after their first album because that album had been only the second Liberty Records release of 1967 to actually make the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, the first being Gary Lewis & the Playboys ""You Don't Have To Paint Me A Picture"" LP, which charted in February.  Unfortunately, ""Ricochet"" would fail to make the charts.  The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (aka The Dirt Band) is notable for having many additional charting albums and singles. Kentucky Blue Collar Band: Kentucky Blue Collar Band are an American country rock band.  They were founded in 2004 deep in the foothills of Eastern Kentucky as the Blue Collar Band, composed of Goble Cantrell (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Mark Rohan (drums) along with Don Hayes (lead guitar) and Dean Ball (bass guitar).  After discovering that another band already existed in Louisville, Kentucky with the name ""Blue Collar Band"", the band added ""Kentucky"" to its name and thus became the Kentucky Blue Collar Band.

Upon reviewing the context, it is clear that the University of Alabama, led to six national championships by Paul ""Bear"" Bryant, had its first ever Heisman Trophy winner drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL.","Charlie Ward: Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee.  Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft.  He won the College Football National Championship with the Florida State University Seminoles.  Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals.  He was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.  An avid tennis player, Ward also displayed his skills at the Arthur Ashe Tennis Tournament in 1994. Bear Bryant: Paul William ""Bear"" Bryant (September 11, 1913 – January 26, 1983) was an American college football player and coach.  He was best known as the longtime head coach of the University of Alabama football team.  During his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach, he amassed six national championships and thirteen conference championships.  Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the record for most wins as head coach in collegiate football history with 323 wins.  The Paul W. Bryant Museum, Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive, and Bryant–Denny Stadium are all named in his honor at the University of Alabama.  He was also known for his trademark black and white houndstooth hat, deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines.  Before arriving at Alabama, Bryant was head football coach at the University of Maryland, the University of Kentucky, and Texas A&M University. 2012 Texas A&amp;M vs. Alabama football game: The 2012 Texas A&M vs. Alabama football game was a college football game between the Texas A&M Aggies and Alabama Crimson Tide at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  This was the game where Texas A&M freshman quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel completed 24 of 31 passes, had 253 passing yards, and two passing touchdowns with 92 rushing yards to help No. 15 Texas A&M upset No. 1 Alabama 29–24, which led him to being the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy. Heisman curse: The Heisman curse is a term coined to reference a two-part assertion of a negative future for the winning player of the Heisman Trophy.  The ""curse"" supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game.  The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1–5 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4–8 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1–6).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the ""curse"" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables. 2003 Cincinnati Bengals season: The 2003 Cincinnati Bengals season was the team's 36th year in professional football and its 34th with the National Football League.  The Bengals are now under first year Head Coach Marvin Lewis, who replaced Dick LeBeau who was fired following the 2002 season after the worst season in Bengals history.  The Bengals had the first pick overall in the 2003 NFL Draft and drafted Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer with the first pick.  After a slow start, the Bengals got hot winning at midseason, winning four straight games to stand at 7–5, entering a key Week 14 matchup with the Baltimore Ravens with a chance to win the division.  However in the key showdown for first place the Bengals showed they were not quite ready for primetime as they were beaten 31–13.  The Bengals would rebound to win their next game against the San Francisco 49ers, but at 8–6 the Bengals could not get that ninth win, losing their last two games to spoil an effort to earn their first winning season in 13 years, finishing at 8–8. Mark Ingram Jr.: Mark Ingram Jr. (born December 21, 1989) is an American football running back for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL).  He played college football for the University of Alabama, won the Heisman Trophy, and was a member of a national championship team.  The New Orleans Saints chose him in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Alabama Crimson Tide football: The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama (variously Alabama, UA, or 'Bama) in the sport of American football.  The team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).  The team is currently coached by Nick Saban.  The Crimson Tide is among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history.  Since beginning play in 1892, the program claims 16 national championships, including 11 wire-service (AP or Coaches) national titles in the poll-era, and five other titles before the poll-era.  From 1958 to 1982, the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant, who won six national championships with the program.  Despite numerous national and conference championships, it was not until 2009 that an Alabama player received a Heisman Trophy, when running back Mark Ingram became the university's first winner.  In 2015, Derrick Henry became the university's second Heisman winner. Ruth Pickett Thompson: Ruth Pickett Thompson is a former All-American synchronized swimmer for the University of Michigan.  A native of Richmond, Virginia, she was named an All-American in four consecutive years from 1978 to 1981, and also placed among the top three individuals at the Intercollegiate Synchronized Swimming Championships in each of those years.  Synchronized swimming was one of the six original varsity sports for women.  Under the coaching of Joyce Lindeman, the varsity team finished second in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women tournament in 1977 and 1978.  Thompson was the leader of the 1977 and 1978 squads, and was honored with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women's 1979 and 1980 Broderick Awards as the nation's top collegiate athlete in her sport.  She also received the 1981 Marie Hartwig Award winner as the University of Michigan's female athlete of the year.  In 1998, she received the Gerald R. Ford Award, presented each year to a single former student-athlete who epitomizes excellence in scholarship, sport and society.  In February 2008, she was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor along with Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard.  In February 2008, Thompson said the Ford Award and the induction into the Hall of Honor rank at the top of her top achievements.  ""I was quite surprised when I got the phone call, so I was very thrilled and honored to be recognized by the university and athletic department,"" she said.  Her two sons, both students at the University of Michigan, attended the Hall of Honor induction ceremonies.  She noted at the time: ""My children and husband were thrilled about this award because Desmond Howard was being inducted with me, so this one is a lot cooler"" than other honors.  Thompson remains involved with synchronized swimming, swimming with U-M's masters group, which takes part in the national competition every year.  She currently lives in the St. Clair County, Michigan, works as a substitute teacher and volunteers in school, community and church organizations. Kinnick Stadium: Kinnick Stadium, formerly known as Iowa Stadium, is a stadium located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.  It is the home stadium of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes, in the sport of college football.  First opened in 1929, it currently holds up to 70,585 people, making it the 7th largest stadium in the Big Ten, and one of the 20 largest university owned stadiums in the nation.  It is named for Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during World War II.  It was named Iowa Stadium until 1972, when longtime lobbying by ""Cedar Rapids Gazette"" sportswriter Gus Schrader successfully convinced the UI athletic board to change the name.  It is currently the only college football stadium named after a Heisman Trophy winner. 1988 Los Angeles Raiders season: The 1988 Los Angeles Raiders season was the club's 29th season in the NFL.  Mike Shanahan was hired as head coach, and the club finished with a 7–9 record.  The Raiders drafted Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, making Brown the third person on the Raiders roster to have won the Heisman Trophy, the others being Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson.  Most of the team's success throughout the season came through their division, as the Raiders finished 6-2 against the weak AFC West division, with their only 2 losses against the champions of the division, the Seattle Seahawks.  However, the Raiders were only 1-7 against the rest of the NFL, with their only other win coming against the eventual champions, the 49ers in San Francisco in a game in which only field goals were kicked.

It gets its name from the Gaelic ""cìosamul"" meaning ""castle island"". Wolgast Castle: Wolgast Castle was a Castle in the city of Wolgast in the northeast of today's Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  It was located on a small barrier island in the Peenestrom, the strait which separates Usedom island from the mainland.  The island is still called ""Castle Island"".  The castle was one of the most important Renaissance buildings in Northern Germany.  It existed from 1496, when it replaced an earlier castle on the island, until it was demolished in the 1820s.  After it was demolished, the materials were used to constrcut other building, so no ruins exist.  Only a few items from the castle have been preserved in various exhibitions.  A reminder of the castle is the coat of arms of the city of Wolgast, which shows a castle tower between two griffins. Clare Castle: Clare Castle is a medieval castle in the small town of Clare in Suffolk, England.  Built shortly after the Norman conquest of England by Richard Fitz Gilbert, the motte and bailey castle was later improved in stone.  In the 14th century the castle was the home of Elizabeth de Clare, one of the richest women in England, who maintained a substantial household there.  The castle passed into the hands of the Crown, and by the 16th century was in ruins.  Damaged by the construction of the Great Eastern Railway through the castle in 1867, the remains of the castle are now part of a local park and a scheduled monument and a grade 2* listed building. Castle Acre Castle and town walls: Castle Acre Castle and town walls are a set of ruined medieval defences built in the village of Castle Acre, Norfolk.  The castle was built soon after the Norman Conquest by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, at the intersection of the River Nar and the Peddars Way.  William constructed a motte-and-bailey castle during the 1070s, protected by large earthwork ramparts, with a large country house in the centre of the motte.  Soon after, a small community of Cluniac monks were given the castle's chapel in the outer bailey; under William, the second earl, the order was given land and estates to establish Castle Acre Priory alongside the castle.  A deer park was created nearby for hunting. Dunderave Castle: Dunderave Castle is an L-plan castle built in the 16th century as the Scottish seat of the MacNaughton clan.  The castle lies on a small promontory on the northern shores of Loch Fyne, around 5 km north-east of Inveraray, Argyll.  The castle is in use as a residence.  The present castle was built after their previous castle was destroyed following a Plague infection.  The old castle, and remnants of McNaughton crannógs, can still be seen on the lochan known as the Dubh Loch at the head of Glen Shira. Hayashi Castle: Hayashi castle was a 15th-century castle, (alternatively known as Hayashi-jo, Fukuyama-jo) in Satoyamabe village, Matsumoto city, Nagano, Japan.  A mountain-type castle, it is now largely in ruins.  The site is sometimes regarded as one castle, or two castles, Hayashikojo (the small castle) and Hayashiohjo (the larger castle). Castlebay: Castlebay (Scottish Gaelic: ""Bàgh a' Chaisteil"" ) is the main village and a community council area on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.  The village is located on the south coast of the island, and overlooks a bay in the Atlantic Ocean dominated by Kisimul Castle, as well as nearby islands such as Vatersay.  Castlebay is also within the parish of Barra.  The village is located on the A888, which serves as a circular road around Barra. Trifels Castle: Trifels Castle (German: ""Reichsburg Trifels"" ) is a reconstructed medieval castle at an elevation of 500 m near the small town of Annweiler, in the Palatinate region of southwestern Germany.  It is located high above the Queich valley within the Palatinate Forest on one peak of a red sandstone mountain split into three.  Trifels Castle is on the peak of the ""Sonnenberg"", and on both of the other two rock elevations there are castle ruins: Anebos Castle and Scharfenberg Castle (demotically called Münz). Clun Castle: Clun Castle is a ruined castle in the small town of Clun, Shropshire.  Clun Castle was established by the Norman lord Robert de Say after the Norman invasion of England and went on to become an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th century, with an extensive castle-guard system.  Owned for many years by the Fitzalan family, Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack until it was gradually abandoned as a property in favour of the more luxurious Arundel Castle.  The Fitzalans converted Clun Castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th century, complete with pleasure gardens, but by the 16th century the castle was largely ruined.  Slighted in 1646 after the English Civil War Clun remained in poor condition until renovation work in the 1890s. Otočec Castle: Otočec Castle is a castle hotel on a small island in the middle of the Krka River in Otočec, Slovenia.  It is the only water castle in Slovenia.  The castle was first mentioned in documents in the 13th century, although the walls are said to date to the more precise date of 1252.  It was once owned by Ivan Lenković, the chief commander of the Croatia-Slavonia march.  The writer Ivan Tavčar set two of his novels at the castle, ""Otok and Struga"" and ""Janez Sonce"".  The islet is linked to both banks of the river by bridges and the castle has now been converted into a small hotel.  Bradt Travel Guides calls it ""one of the most famous hotels in Slovenia.""

It played a prominent and influential role in the expansion of the Civil Rights movement in Durham.  Terry Sanford, its founder, managed to develop that through the help and involvement of the North Carolina Fund.  A Member of the Democratic Party, Sanford was the former governor of North Carolina and was highly respected for his intervention in the improvement of public education.  Indeed, in the 1960s, the education system in place in North Carolina was very poor as one quarter of the adults above 25 years old had received an education inferior to sixth grade, making most of them illiterate.  Because of the high success of the program, the concept developed through the North Carolina Fund was mimicked throughout the nation, transforming what initially was a state wide program to a national program.  Throughout this movement, activism played a fundamental role as the main aim of the program consisted in changing the economic situation of a state through the use of political and social power. Welcome to Durham, USA: Welcome to Durham, USA is a documentary about gang violence in Durham, North Carolina. Louis Austin: Louis Austin (1898-1971) was an African American journalist, leader and social activist.  Austin purchased ""The Carolina Times"" in 1927 and transformed it into an institution that aided African Americans in their fight for freedom and equality in North Carolina.  He used a new approach to Civil Rights issues in Durham, incorporating lower and middle class blacks, unlike the moderate, accommodationist approach of the black elite in Durham during this time.  Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change.  Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern Civil Rights Movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active.  His strategies—which were once considered too radical by his peers—allowed Austin to maintain his influence in Durham well into the 1950s and 1960s.  In doing so, Austin created a lasting impact for Durham. Research Triangle: The Research Triangle, commonly referred to as simply The Triangle, is a region in the Piedmont of North Carolina in the United States, anchored by North Carolina State University, Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill.  The eight-county region, officially named the Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh and Durham–Chapel Hill metropolitan areas and the Dunn, Henderson, Oxford, and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Areas.  A 2013 Census estimate put the population at 2,037,430, making it the second largest metropolitan area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte.  The Raleigh–Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons. Erwin Mill: Erwin Mill was a textile mill in Durham, North Carolina that operated between the years of 1893 and 1986.  After seeing the success of other cotton mills in the Northeast and locally in Durham, entrepreneur Benjamin N. Duke incorporated the mill in 1892 and recruited William H. Erwin to manage the enterprise.  The mill’s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin’s and his successors’ exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers.  The mill grew quickly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, became one of North Carolina’s largest cotton mills.  It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to other fabrics, becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s.  Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States.  Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century.  The establishment of homes, businesses and recreation areas in the mill village was a significant factor in the development of the West Durham, especially the Ninth Street business district and the Old West Durham Neighborhood.  Erwin Mill No. 1 is on the National Register of Historic Places and the mill village of West Durham is a National Historic District.  An apartment complex, office building and shopping center of the same name that are built on the original site also commemorate the factory. The Agronomist: The Agronomist is a 2003 American documentary directed by Jonathan Demme, and starring Jean Dominique.  The documentary follows the life of Dominique, who ran Haiti's first independent radio station, Radio Haiti-Inter, during multiple repressive regimes. North Carolina Specialty Hospital: North Carolina Specialty Hospital (NCSH) is a specialty hospital located in northern Durham, North Carolina.  The hospital provides orthopaedic, ophthalmogic, otolaryngology (ENT), plastic, and general surgery care, as well as pain management techniques and podiatric care.  NCSH is the oldest hospital in Durham, dating back to 1926, when it was formed as an eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital originally known as McPherson Hospital, named after Dr. Samuel McPherson, an EENT specialist.  In the early-1990s, the hospital was renamed as the North Carolina Eye and Ear Hospital.  It was located at the time in its original building in downtown Durham, near the East Campus of Duke University.  In May 2005, NCSH moved to its current location in northern Durham, and was renamed as North Carolina Specialty Hospital in 2000. Edgemont (Durham, North Carolina): The Edgemont neighborhood is a community of mill works located in Durham, North Carolina.  Previously known as Smoky Hollow, this area developed around the Durham Hosiery Mills in the late 19th century.  Durham was a “raw whistle-stop village” along the Great North Carolina Central Rail Road that transformed into one of the largest tobacco cities in the United States.  The Durham City Bull became one of the better-known tobacco trademarks with the help of the big players in the industry, W. T. Blackwell and Company and Julian Carr.  The success of these tobacco mills started overflowing into other industries, mainly textile mills that produced cloth bags, socks, and other hosieries.  As demands rose, communities began growing and changing around the factories.  A shift in the racial make up of the workforce was reflected in Edgemont’s shift to a more African American dominant community as the years progressed.  Julian Carr Jr. was one of the first to allow black workers in factory level jobs to help cope with the high demands.  This industrialist’s decision to reach over the race barrier is part of what made Durham “the City of the New South.”  The Edgemont Neighborhood is just one of many examples of how Durham became one of the more progressive and tolerant locations for African Americans in the country.

"Which member of the band Bad Seeds was older, Anita Lane or Nick Cave?",Anita Lane,Anita Lane.,Anita Lane,Anita Lane is older than Nick Cave.,Anita Lane is older than Nick Cave.,Anita Lane was older than Nick Cave.,"List of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds band members: The following is a complete chronology of the various line-ups of the multinational alternative rock music group Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (briefly ""Nick Cave – Man or Myth?""  and later ""Nick Cave and the Cavemen"") formed in late 1983 in Melbourne, Australia, by five musicians, including several former members of the group The Birthday Party shortly after this band's demise, and is thus seen as its continuation. Anita Lane: Anita Louise Lane (born ca. 1959) is an Australian singer-songwriter who was briefly a member of the Bad Seeds with Nick Cave and Mick Harvey, and has collaborated with both former band mates.  Lane has released two solo albums, ""Dirty Pearl"" (1993) and ""Sex O'Clock"" (2001). Thomas Wydler: Thomas Wydler (born 9 October 1959, Zurich, Switzerland), is a Swiss musician best known for being a core member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, of which he has been a drummer since 1985.  Prior to joining them, he was a member of the experimental German band Die Haut.  Wydler has been present on almost every Bad Seeds album, making his debut appearance on the group's third album ""Kicking Against The Pricks"" (1986).  After the departure of founding member Mick Harvey in January 2009, Wydler became the longest-serving member of the Bad Seeds apart from singer Nick Cave. Warren Ellis (musician): Warren Ellis (born 14 February 1965) is an Australian-French musician and composer.  He is a member of several groups: Dirty Three, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Grinderman.  He has also composed film scores with Nick Cave.  Ellis plays violin, piano, bouzouki, guitar, flute, mandolin, tenor guitar, and viola.  Ellis has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994. Nocturama (album): Nocturama is the twelfth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released in 2003.  It so far has a Metacritic score of 73 out of 100 based on ""generally favorable reviews"".  To date, it is the last Bad Seeds album to feature founding member Blixa Bargeld.  This album reunited Nick Cave with Nick Launay, who had produced ""Junkyard"" by The Birthday Party 21 years earlier.  It was recorded in one week during an Australian tour in March 2002. Grinderman (album): Grinderman is the eponymous debut studio album by alternative rock band Grinderman, a side project of members of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on March 5, 2007 on Mute Records in Europe and ANTI- in the United States.  Aiming to recreate the more raw, primal sound of all former related projects such as The Birthday Party, ""Grinderman""'s lyrical and musical content diverged significantly to Nick Cave's concurrent work with The Bad Seeds, whose last studio album, ""Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus"" (2004), was primarily blues, gospel and alternative-orientated in stark contrast to the raw sound of the early Bad Seeds albums.  Incidentally, the musical direction of ""Grinderman"" influenced The Bad Seeds' next studio album, ""Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! "" (2008). Original Seeds: Original Seeds: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is a compilation album by Various Artists, which was initially released in June 1998.  It was re-titled as ""Original Seeds Vol 1: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds"" when the follow-up ""Original Seeds Vol 2: Songs that inspired Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds"" appeared in 2004.  Both appeared on the Rubber Records label in Australia and the United Kingdom. Nick Cave: Nicholas Edward Cave {'1': "", '2': "", '3': "", '4': ""} (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer and occasional film actor, best known as the frontman of the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.  Referred to as rock music's ""Prince of Darkness"", Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences, and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love and violence. Liaisons Dangereuses (band): Liaisons Dangereuses was founded by Beate Bartel (Mania D, Einstürzende Neubauten) and Chrislo Haas (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft) together with vocalist Krishna Goineau in 1981.  As a part of the Neue Deutsche Welle scene (especially ""electropunk"" ) in Germany they pioneered electronic body music.  After recording four ten-minute cassettes, they released their sole album in 1981.  The self-titled album was mixed at Conny Plank's studio in Köln.  The group made several live appearances throughout 1981 and 1982 and were occasionally joined by Anita Lane (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and Hideto Sasaki.  The album carried the single ""Los Niños del Parque"" which became an underground hit and has been cited by many prominent Chicago house and Detroit techno DJ's as a crucial influence. From Her to Eternity (song): From Her to Eternity is a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appearing on their debut album ""From Her to Eternity"".  It was written by Barry Adamson, Blixa Bargeld, Nick Cave, Mick Harvey, Anita Lane and Hugo Race and was recorded in March 1984 at Trident Studios.

The strike, which ran from March 7 to August 7, 1988, affected production on movies and TV shows.  At 155 days, it remains the longest strike in the Guild's history, surpassing the 1960 Writers Guild of America strike by one week and the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike by seven weeks. Charlie Bryan: Charlie Bryan (11 December 1933 - 2 November 2013) was the head of the International Association of Machinists union in the southeast United States, during the mid to late 1980s.  He led machinists to strike against Eastern Air Lines and Frank Lorenzo in 1989.

Owens in an October 13, 1976, filing with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CA) for an airline operating certificate.  Although it received its operating certificate from the CAB prior to the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, it is widely recognized as the first post-deregulation start-up.  The airline commenced operations on October 31, 1979. 2008 National Union of Teachers strike: The NUT teacher strike was a 24-hour strike by teachers on 24 April 2008, over the issue of pay.  It was the largest strike in Britain for more than 20 years.  It is also believed that up to 8000 schools were affected by this strike.There was also a strike by the UCU, which is the teachers' trade union for further education, with over 1000 members of the UCU joining a march in London 2005 New York City transit strike: The 2005 New York City transit strike was a strike in New York City called by the Transport Workers Union Local 100 (TWU).  Negotiations for a new contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) broke down over retirement, pension, and wage increases.  The strike began at 3:00 a.m. EST on December 20, 2005.  Most New York City Transit Authority and MTA Bus Company personnel observed the strike, effectively halting all service on the subway and buses, except for routes operated from the Spring Creek Depot, where workers represented by ATU Local 1181/1061 had a contract in force after striking against the predecessor operator, Command Bus Company, the previous year.  Millions of commuters were affected.  The strike officially ended at 2:35 p.m. EST on December 22, 2005.  Service was restored overnight, with all transportation systems fully operational by the morning commute of the 23rd. Frank Lorenzo: Francisco Anthony ""Frank"" Lorenzo (born May 19, 1940) is an American businessman and philanthropist.  He is most famous for his leadership of Texas International Airlines and its successor holding company Texas Air Corporation between 1972 and 1990, through which he formed or acquired a number of major U.S. airlines including Continental Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, New York Air and People Express Airlines. 1905 Chicago teamsters' strike: The 1905 Chicago Teamsters' strike was a sympathy strike and lockout by the United Brotherhood of Teamsters in the summer of 1905 in the city of Chicago, Illinois.  The strike was initiated by a small clothing workers' union.  But it soon spread as nearly every union in the city, including the Teamsters, supported the job action with sympathy strikes.  Initially, the strike was aimed at the Montgomery Ward department store, but it affected almost every employer in the metropolitan region after the Teamsters walked out.  The strike eventually pitted the Teamsters against the Employers' Association of Chicago, a broad coalition of business owners formed a few years earlier to oppose unionization in Chicago. Ryan Airline Company: Ryan Airline Company was an airline founded by T. Claude Ryan and Benjamin Franklin ""Frank"" Mahoney at San Diego, California on April 19, 1925.  They had earlier established a scheduled service between San Diego and Los Angeles with a fare of $14.50 one-way and $22.50 round-trip. Little Steel strike: The Little Steel strike was a 1937 labor strike by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and its branch the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), against a number of smaller steel producing companies, principally Republic Steel, Inland Steel, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company.  The strike affected a total of thirty different mills belonging to the three companies, which employed 80,000 workers.  The strike, which was one of the most violent labor disputes of the 1930s, ended without the strikers achieving their principal goal, recognition by the companies of the union as the bargaining agent for the workers. Battle of the Viaduct: The Battle of the Viaduct was an event that took place in Chicago due to a much larger and more prolific event, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.  The strike began on July 14, 1877 in Virginia, during a time of great economic woe throughout the country, thus it quickly gained momentum, eventually becoming the first national strike in United States' History.  The city of Chicago was quickly affected by the strike.  Being one of the most heavily populated cities in America at the time, crowds gathered in extreme numbers to partake in the upheaval.  One specific area, the Halsted Street viaduct, saw a huge number of people gather and protest.  They began to get violent, and in return they were met by fierce retaliation from the authorities.  The conflict that ensued between the two sides quickly turned bloody, and the event that took place became known as the Battle of the Viaduct.

Subsequent recordings included ""Vision and Dreams"" (1990) which was distributed by Word Records, and ""Big Silent World"" (1993), on Germany's Pila Music label. Yang people: The Yang people, also known as the Nhang or Nyang (autonym: ""jaŋ13""), are a Tai-speaking ethnic group of Phongsaly Province, northwestern Laos.

China's armies have long benefited from this rich strategic tradition, influenced by texts such as Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"", that have deeply influenced military thought.

The works of well known strategists such as Sun Tzu and Sun Bin have heavily influenced military philosophy, warfare, and political discourse throughout China's long history.  Works such as ""The Art of War"" have also found a strong following around the world, where they have influenced people as far ranging as the Chinese Communist Party and the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

It is capable of infecting versions of Windows from 95 to 10.  Written in Delphi and released first by its author Tataye in 2002, it became quite popular due to its unique features.  It used the typical client–server model where the client would be under operation by the attacker and the server is what would infect the victim.  Beast was one of the first trojans to feature a reverse connection to its victims, and once established it gave the attacker complete control over the infected computer.  The virus would be harmless until opened.  When opened, the virus would use the code injection method to inject itself into other applications. Mor-Tax: Mor-Tax is the name of the planet on which the aliens from the first season of the ""War of the Worlds"" TV series, the Mor-Taxans, originate.  While the show's existence as a continuation from the 1953 film would make the aliens Martians, the first season rewrites this origin due to the supported fact that no intelligent life is evident to exist or have existed on Mars.  Their connection to Mars is never mentioned onscreen, though creator/executive producer Greg Strangis has stated in an interview that the aliens used Mars only as a staging point to launch their invasion on Earth; the veterans of the Grover's Mill militia obliviously call them Martians. Sneha (actress): Suhasini Rajaram Naidu, popularly known by her stage name Sneha, is an Indian film actress, who works in the South Indian film industry.  She debuted in the Malayalam film ""Ingane Oru Nilapakshi"" (2000), directed by Anil – Babu and was later signed for the Tamil film ""Virumbugiren"", though it was only released two years later.  She started getting offers in Tamil and moved her focus to Kollywood, and the movie ""Ennavale"", where she starred opposite R. Madhavan, was released first in the same year. Rebecca (2015 film): Rebeccais a 2016 Ghana-Nigeria film directed by Shirley Frimpong-Manso, and starring Yvonne Okoro and Joseph Benjamin (actor).  According to Manso, the film was released first in London, before Ghana due to the economic situation of the country causing reduced patronage for films.  The film is the second two cast film that features Nigerian born actress Yvonne Okoro. The London Connection: The London Connection is a 1979 film directed by Robert Clouse for Walt Disney Productions.  It stars Jeffrey Byron and Larry Cedar.

Curly Ray Cline: Curly Ray Cline (January 10, 1923 – August 19, 1997) was an American bluegrass fiddler from West Virginia known for his work with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers and Ralph Stanley. Lonesome Pine Fiddlers: The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers (1938- 1966) were an early bluegrass band which included such notable ""first generation"" bluegrass musicians as Ezra Cline, Bobby Osborne, Paul Williams, Melvin Goins, Charlie Cline, Curly Ray Cline, Larry Richardson and for a short time Jimmy Martin.  The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named ""Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers"".  The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people.  Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers.  For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting.  None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched.  Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.  Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).  Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award.  In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play.  (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage).  The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of ""Pain in my Heart"" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening.

Are Manettia and Fragaria both edible?,Yes,Yes,Yes.,"Apologies for any confusion. Based on the context provided, Fragaria is edible as it is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as strawberries, which are grown and consumed worldwide for their fruit. However, there is no information provided in the context about the edibility of Manettia.","Both Manettia and Fragaria are not explicitly mentioned as being edible in the provided context. While Fragaria is commonly known as strawberries and is widely grown for its fruit, it does not specify the edibility of Manettia. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to definitively state that both Manettia and Fragaria are edible based solely on the given information.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Upon reviewing the provided context, it is clear that Fragaria, which is commonly known as strawberries, is indeed edible. However, there is no specific information provided in the context about the edibility of Manettia. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether Manettia is edible or not based on the given information.","Fragaria × bringhurstii: Fragaria"" × ""bringhurstii is a naturally occurring hybrid species of strawberry native to the West Coast of the United States.  The species results from the natural intercrossing of ""Fragaria vesca"" and ""Fragaria chiloensis"", native species whose ranges overlap in that region. Manettia: Manettia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.  There are between 80 and 123 species.  They are distributed in the West Indies, Mexico, and Central and South America.  Most are vines.  The genus was named after Saverio Manetti. Fragaria × vescana: Fragaria × vescana is a hybrid strawberry cultivar that was created in an effort to combine the best traits of the garden strawberry (""Fragaria"" × ""ananassa""), which has large berries and vigorous plants, with the woodland strawberry (""Fragaria vesca""), which has an exquisite flavour, but small berries. Fragaria × Comarum hybrids: There are several commercially important hybrids between ""Fragaria"" and ""Comarum"" species in existence, but they have not yet received formal botanical names as hybrids between those genera.  Both ""Fragaria"" and ""Comarum"" have at different times been considered to be part of the genus ""Potentilla"", and these hybrids have been named Potentilla"" x ""rosea, or are sometimes referred to as ""Fragaria"" × ""Potentilla"" hybrids. Fragaria nipponica: Fragaria nipponica is a species of strawberry native to the western side of the Japanese island of Honshū, with a variety ""Fragaria nipponica"" var.  ""yakusimensis"" on Yakushima.  Some botanists treat it as a synonym of ""Fragaria yezoensis"". Fragaria: Fragaria is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits.  There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars.  The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as ""Fragaria"" × ""ananassa"".  Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart.  Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world. 1105 Fragaria: 1105 Fragaria (1929 AB) is Main-belt asteroid discovered on January 1, 1929, by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth at the Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl in Heidelberg, Germany.  It was named after Fragaria, the genus of flowering plants in the rose family.  It is a member of the Eos family. Strawberry: The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus ""Fragaria"", collectively known as the strawberries.  It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit.  The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.  It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. Fragaria cascadensis: Fragaria cascadensis, is a species of strawberry (""Fragaria""), found in the Cascades Mountains described in 2012.  The vernacular name ""Cascade strawberry"" was suggested by the describing author. Fragaria iturupensis: Fragaria iturupensis, the Iturup strawberry, is a species of strawberry, endemic to Iturup in the Kuril Islands.  It is noted to have relatively large berries for a wild species, similar in appearance to those of ""Fragaria virginiana"".

Nikolaas Tinbergen shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz. Karl von Frisch was an Austrian ethologist.,Apologies for any confusion caused. The correct answer to the question is Karl von Frisch. Nikolaas Tinbergen shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz.,"William Homan Thorpe: William Homan Thorpe FRS (1 April 1902 – 7 April 1986) was Professor of Animal Ethology at the University of Cambridge, and a significant British zoologist, ethologist and ornithologist.  Together with Nikolaas Tinbergen, Patrick Bateson and Robert Hinde, Thorpe contributed to the growth and acceptance of behavioural biology in Great Britain. Jan Tinbergen: Jan Tinbergen ( ; ] ; April 12, 1903June 9, 1994) was an important Dutch economist.  He was awarded the first Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1969, which he shared with Ragnar Frisch for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes.  He is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and one of the founding fathers of econometrics.  It has been argued that the development of the first macro econometric models, the solution of the identification problem, and the understanding of dynamic models are his three most important legacies to econometrics.  Tinbergen was a founding trustee of Economists for Peace and Security.  In 1945, he founded the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) and was the agency's first director. Konrad Lorenz: Konrad Zacharias Lorenz (] ; 7 November 1903 – 27 February 1989) was an Austrian zoologist, ethologist, and ornithologist.  He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Nikolaas Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch.  He is often regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, the study of animal behaviour.  He developed an approach that began with an earlier generation, including his teacher Oskar Heinroth. Gerard Baerends: Gerardus Pieter Baerends (30 March 1916, The Hague – 1 September 1999, Groningen) was a Dutch biologist and one of the most important representatives of the so-called classical ethology in the tradition of Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz.  Baerends' behavioral working group was the first of this specialty in the Netherlands and is still regarded as one of the world's most prolific, since from it alone 43 theses emerged. Karl von Frisch: Karl Ritter von Frisch, {'1': "", '2': "", '3': 'ForMemRS', '4': ""} (20 November 1886 – 12 June 1982) was an Austrian ethologist who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973, along with Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. Nikolaas Tinbergen: Nikolaas 'Niko' Tinbergen {'1': "", '2': "", '3': "", '4': ""} ( ; ] ; 15 April 1907 – 21 December 1988) was a Dutch biologist and ornithologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz for their discoveries concerning organisation and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns in animals.  He is regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, the study of animal behaviour. Hawk/goose effect: In ethology and cognitive ethology, the hawk/goose effect refers to a behavior observed in some young birds when another bird flies above them: if the flying bird is a goose, the young birds show no reaction, but if the flying bird is a hawk, the young birds either become more agitated or cower to reduce the danger.  It was first observed by Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen. Trap-lining: In ethology and behavioral ecology, trap-lining or traplining is a feeding strategy in which an individual visits food sources on a regular, repeatable sequence, much as trappers check their lines of traps.  Traplining is usually seen in species foraging for floral resources.  This involves a specified route in which the individual traverses in the same order repeatedly to check specific plants for flowers that hold nectar, even over long distances.  Trap-lining has been described in several taxa (sing.  taxon), including bees, butterflies, tamarins, bats, rats, and hummingbirds and tropical fruit-eating mammals such as opossums, capuchins and kinkajous.  Traplining is used to term the method in which bumblebees and hummingbirds go about collecting nectar, and consequently, pollinating each plant they visit.  The term ""traplining"" was originally coined by Daniel Janzen, although the concept was discussed by Charles Darwin and Nikolaas Tinbergen. Tinbergen's four questions: Tinbergen's four questions, named after Nikolaas Tinbergen and based on Aristotle's four causes. , are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour.  These are also commonly referred to as levels of analysis.  It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms. Ethology: Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait.  Behaviourism is a term that also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity.  Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history.  Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig.  The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology.  Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.

From March 2009, Lou became a part-time regular character, with Oliver alternating between two-month blocks of filming and two-month breaks.  In 2015, it was announced that Oliver would no longer be appearing as regularly on the show, and Lou made a temporary departure on 1 May 2015.

He was a member of the founding board of NPR and the author of its original “mission statement,” the ""National Public Radio Purposes"".  As NPR's first director of programming Siemering helped shaped its flagship program ""All Things Considered"" into an influential and enduring fixture of American media.  After a decades-long career in public radio, Siemering embarked on a second career of nurturing independent radio in the developing world. Ellen Weiss: Ellen Weiss (born January 30, 1959) is an American journalist and four-time Peabody Award winner.  She joined National Public Radio (NPR) in 1982, eventually running the NPR News national desk and serving as executive producer of the NPR News magazine ""All Things Considered"".  She was named NPR vice president for news in April 2007 and held that post until January 2011, in the wake of her termination of former NPR reporter Juan Williams.  She was executive editor at the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity and since 2013 has been the Washington DC Bureau Chief and Vice-President for the E.W. Scripps Company.  In 2015, she won her fourth Peabody award for a story about soldiers discharged from the military for sexual crimes who evade registering as sex offenders after leaving the military. Jazz Profiles: Jazz Profiles is an American radio show produced by NPR and hosted by jazz singer Nancy Wilson.  It features hour long retrospectives on the lives of famous jazz musicians, or sometimes on famous albums such as Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"".  The show covers a wide range of jazz musicians, from the very famous to the lesser known but still notable ones, such as Jon Hendricks.  It won a Peabody Award in 2002 ""for an innovative presentation of the world of jazz, honoring the works and the great artists of this unique American musical form."" Piano Jazz: Piano Jazz is a weekly one-hour radio show produced and distributed by National Public Radio (NPR).  It began on June 4, 1978, and was hosted by jazz pianist Marian McPartland (1918–2013) until 2011.  It is the longest-running cultural program on NPR.  The show generally features a single guest (though small groups and duos are also featured at times), and usually consists of about an equal mixture of discussion and playing, often duets with McPartland.  Initially the guests were limited to jazz pianists, but the format was later expanded to include performers on other instruments as well as other genres (though the performances remain focused on jazz tunes).  The show provides an inside look at the relationships of jazz musicians, since McPartland often had long friendships with many of her guests.  ""Piano Jazz"" won a Peabody Award in 1983.  The show is an exclusive production of South Carolina public radio on WLTR and is offered nationally by NPR.

The agencies are responsible for collecting and producing foreign and domestic intelligence, providing military intelligence, performing espionage and counter-espionage.  Their intelligence assessments contribute to the conduct of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom, maintaining the national security of the United Kingdom, military planning and law enforcement in the United Kingdom.  The three main agencies are the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the Security Service (MI5), and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). MI5: The Security Service, also MI5 (Military Intelligence, Section 5), is the United Kingdom's domestic counter-intelligence and security agency and is part of its intelligence machinery alongside the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Defence Intelligence (DI).  MI5 is directed by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), and the service is bound by the Security Service Act 1989.  The service is directed to protect British parliamentary democracy and economic interests, and counter terrorism and espionage within the UK. Spy film: The spy film genre deals with the subject of fictional espionage, either in a realistic way (such as the adaptations of John le Carré) or as a basis for fantasy (such as many James Bond films).  Many novels in the spy fiction genre have been adapted as films, including works by John Buchan, le Carré, Ian Fleming (Bond) and Len Deighton.  It is a significant aspect of British cinema, with leading British directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Carol Reed making notable contributions and many films set in the British Secret Service. Call for the Dead: Call for the Dead is John le Carré's first novel, published in 1961.  It introduces George Smiley, the most famous of le Carré's recurring characters, in a story about East German spies inside Great Britain.  It also introduces a fictional version of British Intelligence, called ""the Circus"" because of its location in Cambridge Circus, that is apparently based on MI6 and that recurs throughout le Carré's spy novels. Control (fictional character): Control is a fictional character created by John le Carré.  Control is an intelligence officer who acts as the head of ""the Circus"", the British overseas intelligence agency.  He is a character in the novels ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", ""The Looking Glass War"", and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", and is referred to in several others, usually by association with le Carré's recurring protagonist George Smiley, who has served as Control's right-hand man. Glenmore Trenear-Harvey: Glenmore Stratton Trenear-Harvey (born 29 December 1940) is a British intelligence analyst who writes, broadcasts and lectures on the subjects of security, intelligence, espionage and terrorism.  He is the editor-in-chief of the ""World Intelligence Review"", an associate editor of ""Eye Spy"" intelligence magazine, and publisher of ""Intelligence Digest"".  Trenear-Harvey is an intelligence analyst for Sky News, and also broadcasts on NBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, France 24, Russia Today, and the BBC.  He hosted the weekly show ""Energy World"" several times, on the satellite channel Press TV.  He claims to receive regular briefings from Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and Security Service (MI5) and maintains contact with former (and he claims serving) intelligence officers of the American, British, and former Soviet security and intelligence services. The Russia House: The Russia House is a spy novel by John le Carré published in 1989.  The title refers to the nickname given to the portion of the British Secret Intelligence Service that was devoted to spying on the Soviet Union.  A film based on the novel was released in 1990 starring Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, and directed by Fred Schepisi.  The BBC produced a radio play starring Tom Baker. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 1974 spy novel by British author John le Carré.  It follows the endeavors of taciturn, aging spymaster George Smiley to uncover a Soviet mole in the British Secret Intelligence Service.  Since the time of its publication, the novel has received critical acclaim for its complex social commentary and lack of sensationalism, and remains a staple of the spy fiction genre. John le Carré: David John Moore Cornwell (born 19 October 1931), known by the pseudonym John le Carré ( ), is a British author of espionage novels.  During the 1950s and the 1960s, he worked for both the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service, and began writing novels under his pen name.  His third novel, ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" (1963), became an international best-seller and remains one of his best-known works.  Following the success of this novel, he left MI6 to become a full-time author. Audre Lorde: Audre Lorde ( ; born Audrey Geraldine Lorde; February 18, 1934 – November 17, 1992) was a writer, feminist, womanist, librarian, and civil rights activist.  As a poet, she is best known for technical mastery and emotional expression, as well as her poems that express anger and outrage at civil and social injustices she observed throughout her life.  Her poems and prose largely deal with issues related to civil rights, feminism, and the exploration of black female identity.  In relation to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, ""Those of us who stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; those of us who have been forged in the crucibles of difference -- those of us who are poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill.  It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths.  For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.  They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.  And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support.""

Its major shareholders were Russell Cummins and John Fletcher Moulton M.P. The company was set up to operate gas-powered trams, which it worked initially on the Blackpool, St. Annes and Lytham tramway, the first such tramway in Britain.  The early success of the vehicles led to the company being invited to operate similar schemes in other parts of the country, including a newly constructed three-mile stretch of tramway in Trafford Park.  The Trafford Park service opened on 23 July 1897, but it was suspended only a few days later after two women were injured when one of the trams left the rails, and the service did not resume until 8 April 1898.  The trams were powered by town gas, and had a maximum speed of 12 mph ; their distinctive exhaust smell quickly earned them the nickname ""Lamp Oil Express"".

Syrian nationality law: Syrian nationality law is the law governing the acquisition, transmission and loss of Syrian citizenship.  Syrian citizenship is the status of being a citizen of the Republic of Syria and it can be obtained by birth or naturalisation.  The Syrian nationality is transmitted by paternity (father) (see Jus sanguinis).  Therefore, Syrian nationality is determined solely by the father's nationality, while the place of birth is irrelevant.  In other words, birthright citizenship is not recognized since being born in Syria does not grant an automatic right to become a national.  In most cases, individuals are deemed to be Syrian nationals regardless of whether they are born inside or outside Syria as long as their father holds Syrian nationality.

Upon reviewing the context again, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The context does not provide information about the length of the river on which Wilbur Dam is located.","Apologies for the incorrect response in my previous message. Based on the provided context, the length of the Watauga River, on which Wilbur Dam is located, is not mentioned. The context only states that Wilbur Dam impounds Wilbur Lake, which extends for about 3 miles up the Watauga River to the base of Watauga Dam. Therefore, the exact length of the Watauga River is not specified.","I apologize for the incorrect response. The correct answer is that Wilbur Dam is located on the Watauga River, which is approximately 78.5 miles long.","Wilbur Dam: Wilbur Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Watauga River in Carter County, in the U.S. state of Tennessee.  It is one of two dams on the river owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.  The dam impounds Wilbur Lake, which extends for about 3 mi up the Watauga to the base of Watauga Dam.  Completed by 1912 the Ocoee Dam No. 1 is the only Hydroelectric dam that is older, Wilbur Dam was one of the first major hydroelectric projects in Tennessee, and remains one of the oldest dams in the TVA system. Watauga Dam: Watauga Dam is a hydroelectric and flood control dam on the Watauga River in Carter County, in the U.S. state of Tennessee.  It is owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the 1940s as part of efforts to control flooding in the Tennessee River watershed.  At 318 ft , Watauga is the second-highest dam in the TVA river and reservoir system (behind only Fontana), and at the time of its completion was one of the highest earth-and-rock dams in the United States.  The dam impounds the TVA Watauga Reservoir of 6430 acre , and its tailwaters feed into Wilbur Lake.  The Appalachian Trail crosses the top of Watauga Dam. Black Eagle Dam: Black Eagle Dam is a hydroelectric gravity weir dam located on the Missouri River in the city of Great Falls, Montana.  The first dam on the site, built and opened in 1890, was a timber-and-rock crib dam.  This structure was the first hydroelectric dam built in Montana and the first built on the Missouri River.  The dam helped give the city of Great Falls the nickname ""The Electric City.""  A second dam, built of concrete in 1926 and opened in 1927, replaced the first dam, which was not removed and lies submerged in the reservoir.  Almost unchanged since 1926, the dam is 782 ft long and 34.5 ft high, and its powerhouse contains three turbines capable of generating seven megawatts (MW) of power each.  The maximum power output of the dam is 18 MW.  Montana Power Company built the second dam, PPL Corporation purchased it in 1997 and sold it to NorthWestern Corporation in 2014.  The reservoir behind the dam has no official name, but was called the Long Pool for many years.  The reservoir is about 2 mi long, and has a storage capacity of 1,710 acre.ft to 1,820 acre.ft of water. Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant: The Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant is a 1000 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric power station on the Sutlej River in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India.  The dam and power station are located between the villages of Karcham and Wangtoo where the plant also gains its name.  Jaypee Karcham Hydro Corporation Limited of Jaypee Group signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the dam in 1993 and after years of delays, construction on the power station began on 18 November 2005.  In 2015 Jaypee Group sold out Karcham Wangtoo Project to JSW Group. The first generator was commissioned in May 2011, the second in June and the final two in September.  The 98 m tall dam at Karcham ( ) diverts a substantial portion of the Sutlej into a 10.48 m diameter and 17.2 km long headrace tunnel to the underground power station downstream at Wangtoo.  At the station, the water powers four 250 MW Francis turbine-generators before it is sent back into the Sutlej via a 1.2 km long tailrace tunnel.  The difference in elevation between the dam and the power station affords a gross hydraulic head of 298 m .  Water not diverted by the dam is sent over the spillway and down the normal course of the river.  The main spillway is along the crest of the dam and is controlled by six radial gates. Just upstream of the dam is the 300 MW Baspa II Hydroelectric Plant and downstream of the Karcham Wangtoo is the 1,500 MW Nathpa Jhakri Dam. Culmback Dam: The Culmback Dam (also known as the George Culmback Dam or the Snoqualmie National Forest Dam) is a large rockfill hydroelectric and water supply dam on the Sultan River, a tributary of the Skykomish River, in Washington.  Built in 1965, the dam is 640 ft long at the crest and 262 ft high.  Its reservoir, Spada Lake, provides water for 70 to 75 percent of Snohomish County, and the powerhouse downstream of the dam produces 112 megawatts.  Some critics charge that the dam has strongly impacted the runs of salmon and other migratory fish in the Sultan River by depleting gravel and sediment needed to line the riverbed.  The dam’s operator counters that Culmback Dam dramatically reduces flooding events, benefiting fish populations and the surrounding communities.  The dam was named in honor of George Culmback, a former mayor of Everett. Yunfeng Dam: The Yunfeng Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Yalu River which borders China and North Korea.  It is located 33 km northeast of Ji'an in Jilin Province, China and Manpo in Chagang Province, North Korea.  The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and it supports a 400 MW power station.  Construction of the dam had initially began in August 1942 but was halted in 1945 after the surrender of Japan ending World War II.  In October 1959, construction on the dam recommenced and in September 1965, the first of the four 100 MW Francis turbine-generators was operational.  The last generator was operational on 4 April 1967.  The 113.75 m tall dam creates a reservoir with a storage capacity of 3895000000 m3 .  The dam's spillway is an overflow type with 21 floodgates and has a maximum discharge of 21900 m3/s .  The dam is located before a bend in the river and its power station is located on the other side of a ridge that meets the dam’s right abutment.  Water is delivered to the power station via two tunnels, 775 m and 759 m long.  Generators 1 and 3 deliver power to China while 2 and 4 deliver to North Korea. Diama Dam: The Diama Dam, sometimes referred to as the Maka–Diama Dam, is a gravity dam on the Senegal River, spanning the border of Senegal and Mauritania.  It is located next to the town of Diama, Senegal and about 22 km north of Saint-Louis, Senegal.  The purpose of the dam is to prevent saltwater intrusion upstream, supply water for the irrigation of about 45000 ha of crops and create a road crossing for the road between St. Louis and Nouakchott in Mauritania.  Additionally, a ship lock built within the dam provides for navigation upstream.  Plans for the dam were first drawn in 1970 when the riparian states within the Senegal River Basin Development Authority agreed to develop the Senegal River.  The Diama Dam was to be constructed in conjunction with the Manantali Dam which was to be located further upstream in Mali.  Construction on the Diama Dam began on 15 September 1981 and was completed on 12 August 1986.  The Manantali Dam was completed in 1988.  The Diama project was funded by a US$149.5 million loan from the African Development Bank.  The main section of the dam with ship lock and spillway is 170 m long while a 440 m long embankment dam section extends north to the edge of the river.  A dike further extends the dam to the north.  The dam is 18 m tall and it is spillway has a maximum discharge of 6500 m3/s . Watauga River: The Watauga River is a large stream of western North Carolina and East Tennessee.  It is 78.5 mi long with its headwaters on the slopes of Grandfather Mountain and Peak Mountain in Watauga County, North Carolina. Longshou II Dam: The Longshou II Dam, also referred to as Longshou No. 2, is a concrete-face rock-fill dam on the Heihe River, located 35 km southwest of Zhangye in Gansu Province, China.  It is part of the Gansu Heihe Rural Hydropower Development and supports a 157 MW power station.  The dam's first feasibility study was carried out in 2000 and river diversion construction began in December 2001.  In June 2002, the river was diverted and in September that year, filling of the dam's body began.  On 17 August 2004, the first generator was operational with the rest by the end of the year.  The 146.5 m high dam withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 86200000 m3 .  It's spillway is located on the right bank and is a controlled chute type with a discharge capacity of 2696 m3/s .  Water is delivered to the dam's power station downstream via a 1.7 km long tunnel.  The dam is located upstream of the Longshou I Dam, an 80 m tall double-curvature arch dam with an installed capacity of 52 MW. Lock and Dam No. 15: Lock and Dam No. 15 is a lock and dam located on the Upper Mississippi River.  It spans the river between Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa.  Lock and Dam 15 is the largest roller dam in the world, its dam is 1203 ft long and consists of nine 109 ft non-submersible, non-overflow roller gates and two 109 ft non-submersible overflow roller gates.  It is unusual among the upper Mississippi River dams in that it has only roller gates, has different sizes and types of roller gates, it is not perpendicular to the flow of the river and is one of the few facilities that has a completed auxiliary lock.  The main lock is 110 ft wide by 600 ft long and its auxiliary lock is 110 ft wide by 360 ft long.  In 2004, the facility was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as Lock and Dam No. 15 Historic District, #04000175 covering 3590 acre , 2 buildings, 9 structures, and 1 object.

Based on the given context, the game ""Darwin"" was developed by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. Dennis Ritchie, the man who created the C programming language, was incorrectly cited as a co-author.","Darwin (programming game): Darwin was a programming game invented in August 1961 by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy.  (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.)  The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there.  The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an ""ultimate"" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it. Martin Richards (computer scientist): Martin Richards (born 21 July 1940) is a British computer scientist known for his development of the BCPL programming language which is both part of early research into portable software, and the ancestor of the B programming language invented by Ken Thompson in early versions of Unix and which Dennis Ritchie in turn used as the basis of his widely used C programming language. SystemVerilog DPI: SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface) is an interface which can be used to interface SystemVerilog with foreign languages.  These Foreign languages can be C, C++, SystemC as well as others.  DPIs consist of two layers: A SystemVerilog Layer and a Foreign language layer.  Both the layers are isolated from each other.  Which programming language is actually used as the foreign language is transparent and irrelevant for the System-Verilog side of this interface.  Neither the SystemVerilog compiler nor the foreign language compiler is required to analyze the source code in the other’s language.  Different programming languages can be used and supported with the same intact SystemVerilog layer.  For now, however, SystemVerilog defines a foreign language layer only for the C programming language. Ken Thompson: Kenneth Lane ""Ken"" Thompson (born February 4, 1943), commonly referred to as ken in hacker circles, is an American pioneer of computer science.  Having worked at Bell Labs for most of his career, Thompson designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.  He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating systems.  Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language. Dennis Ritchie: Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.  He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system.  Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.  Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.  He was the ""R"" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr. Objective-C: Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.  It was the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs) Cocoa and Cocoa Touch prior to the introduction of Swift. Embedded C: Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems. Historically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. Cg (programming language): Cg (short for C for Graphics) is a high-level shading language developed by Nvidia in close collaboration with Microsoft for programming vertex and pixel shaders.  Cg is based on the C programming language and although they share the same syntax, some features of C were modified and new data types were added to make Cg more suitable for programming graphics processing units.  This language is only suitable for GPU programming and is not a general programming language.  The Cg compiler outputs DirectX or OpenGL shader programs.  Since 2012, Cg was deprecated, with no additional development or support available. The C Programming Language: The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined.  The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today.  Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the ""de facto"" standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C. BCPL: BCPL (""Basic Combined Programming Language""; or 'Before C Programming Language' (common humorous backronym) ) is a procedural, imperative, and structured computer programming language.  Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use.  However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based.  BCPL introduced several features of modern programming languages, including curley braces notation for code blocks; compilation via virtual machine byte code; and the world's first 'hello world' demonstrator program.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Swedish Academy.  The first Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 1901 to Sully Prudhomme of France.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, Prudhomme received 150,782 SEK, which is equivalent to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007.  The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. A Death in the Family: A Death in the Family is an autobiographical novel by author James Agee, set in Knoxville, Tennessee.  He began writing it in 1948, but it was not quite complete when he died in 1955 (with reputedly many portions having been written in the home of his friend Frances Wickes).  It was edited and released posthumously in 1957 by editor David McDowell.  Agee's widow and children were left with little money after Agee's death and McDowell wanted to help them by publishing the work.  Agee won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1958 for the novel.  The novel was included on ""Time""'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. Nobel Prize in Literature: Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i litteratur"" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: ""den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning"").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here ""work"" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. James Agee: James Rufus Agee ( ; November 27, 1909 – May 16, 1955) was an American novelist, journalist, poet, screenwriter and film critic.  In the 1940s, he was one of the most influential film critics in the U.S. His autobiographical novel, ""A Death in the Family"" (1957), won the author a posthumous 1958 Pulitzer Prize. Nelly Sachs: Nelly Sachs (10 December 1891 – 12 May 1970) was a Swedish poet and playwright of Jewish German birth.  Her experiences resulting from the rise of the Nazis in World War II Europe transformed her into a poignant spokeswoman for the grief and yearnings of her fellow Jews.  Her best-known play is ""Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels "" (1950); other works include the poems ""Zeichen im Sand "" (1962), ""Verzauberung "" (1970), and the collections of poetry ""In den Wohnungen des Todes "" (1947), ""Flucht und Verwandlung "" (1959), ""Fahrt ins Staublose "" (1961), and ""Suche nach Lebenden "" (1971).  She was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966. Matthew Mead (poet): Matthew Mead (born 1924, Buckinghamshire, died 2009) was an English poet as well as a translator, with his wife Ruth, of German poets, including Johannes Bobrowski and Nelly Sachs.  He edited the magazine ""Satis"" and lived in Germany.  A selection of his poems appears in ""Penguin Modern Poets 16"", together with Harry Guest and Jack Beeching. List of Danish Nobel laureates: This is a list of Danish Nobel laureates.  Since the Nobel Prize was established per the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, 12 of the prize winners have been from Denmark.  The first Danish Nobel laureate was Niels Ryberg Finsen, who won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1903 for his work in using light therapy to treat diseases.  The most recent Danish Nobel Prize winner was Jens Skou who won the prize in chemistry for his discovery over the enzyme, Na+/K+-ATPase in 1997.  To date, of the 13 Nobel Prizes won by Danish people, 5 have been for medicine, 3 have been for physics, 3 have been for literature, 1 has been for chemistry and one has been for peace. List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin"" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.  While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for ""physiology or medicine"" in his will.  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.  The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008.  In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof; they were recognised ""after discovering how cells precisely transport material"".

The House (1999 film): The House is a 1999 Chinese film directed by Wang Xiaoshuai.  It is rarely, if ever, screened abroad, and remains one of Wang Xiaoshuai's least well-known works outside of China.  It is alternatively referred to as Suburban Dreams, Fantasy Garden or Dream House.  The film was produced by the Beijing Film Studio and the China Film Group.  Wang Xiaoshuai himself considers it one of his most inconsequential efforts to date, to the extent that it has ""sunk into oblivion."" Frozen (1997 film): Frozen () is a 1997 Chinese film directed by Wang Xiaoshuai.  The film was originally shot in 1994, but was banned by Chinese authorities and had to be smuggled out of the country.  Moreover, Wang was operating under a blacklisting from the Chinese Film Bureau that was imposed after his previous film, ""The Days"", was screened internationally without government approval.  As such, Wang was forced to use the pseudonym ""Wu Ming"" (literally ""Anonymous"") while making this film. Wang Xiaoshuai: Wang Xiaoshuai (; born May 22, 1966) is a Chinese film director, screenwriter and occasional actor.  He is commonly grouped under the loose association of filmmakers known as the ""Sixth Generation"" of the Cinema of China.

Her sister, the screenwriter Ning Dai, is a frequent collaborator and the wife of fellow director Zhang Yuan.  In 1997, she was a member of the jury at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. Del Lord: Del Lord (October 7, 1894March 23, 1970) was a Canadian film director and actor best known as a director of Three Stooges films.

Wang considers ""Red Amnesia"" to be the last film of his Cultural Revolution trilogy, which includes 2005's ""Shanghai Dreams"" and 2011's ""11 Flowers"".  It was released on April 30, 2015. 11 Flowers: 11 Flowers () is a 2011 film directed by Wang Xiaoshuai centered on a boy named Wang Han who loses his white shirt which shows that he is his school's best gymnast.  The loss of the shirt is to take on greater metaphorical meaning as the film progresses which is inspired by the director's own experience as a youth during the cultural revolution and the more general confusion of childhood. So Close to Paradise: So Close to Paradise () is a 1998 Chinese film directed by Wang Xiaoshuai, a member of Chinese cinema's so-called Sixth Generation.

Kirk Wiebe, she filed a complaint to the Department of Defense's Inspector General (DoD IG) about the National Security Agency's highly classified Trailblazer Project.  Her house was raided by armed FBI agents in 2007 after she was wrongly suspected of leaking to ""The New York Times"" reporter James Risen and to Siobhan Gorman at the ""The Baltimore Sun"" in stories about NSA warrantless surveillance.  This led to her suing the government in 2012 because they did not return her computer, which they had seized during the raid, and because the government failed to clear her name.  The punitive treatment of Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis, as well as, and, in particular, then still active (rather than retired) NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake, who had gone in confidence with anonymity assured to the DoD IG, led the Assistant Inspector General John Crane to eventually become a public whistleblower himself and also led Edward Snowden to go public with revelations rather than to report within the internal whistleblower program.

Production of the album was handled by several producers such as Teddy Riley, Theron ""Neff-U"" Feemster, C. ""Tricky"" Stewart, Eddie Cascio, among others and features guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz.

Death Grips discography: American band Death Grips has released six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos.  The band was formed by MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy ""Flatlander"" Morin in Sacramento during the winter of 2010.  In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP.  The mixtape ""Exmilitary"" followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics.  Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album ""The Money Store"" was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the ""Billboard"" 200 chart.  Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album ""No Love Deep Web"" before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012.  As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records.  ""No Love Deep Web"" received positive reviews and peaked at number 2 on the ""Billboard"" Heatseekers chart. 21 Savage: Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name 21 Savage, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia.  He was best known for his mixtapes, ""The Slaughter Tape"" and ""Slaughter King"" and his extended plays ""Free Guwop"" and ""Savage Mode"" with Metro Boomin before the release of his debut album, ""ISSA"" and its lead single, ""Bank Account"". Xscape (album): Xscape is the second posthumous album of previously unreleased tracks by American singer Michael Jackson.  It is his eighth album released through Epic Records, and was released on May 13, 2014 by Epic Records and MJJ Music.  It is the tenth album released by Sony and Motown since Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.  L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records, curated and served as executive producer for the album enlisting Timbaland to lead a team of record producers, including StarGate, Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon, John McClain, and Rodney Jerkins, to remix and contemporize the eight selected tracks.  Jerkins produced the title song and is the only original song producer to work on the final productions. Dance Again... the Hits: Dance Again... the Hits is the first greatest hits album of American singer Jennifer Lopez.  It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, to coincide with the launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour.  Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, ""Love? "", which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010.  As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011.  She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former. Eighteen Visions (album): Eighteen Visions is the eponymous fifth studio album by Eighteen Visions that was released on July 18, 2006.  It was the band's only album released on Epic Records.  This album saw the band take a step away from its metalcore roots in favor of a new, more melodic tone.  Some countries have added two bonus tracks.  One is taken from a Truskill records compilation called ""Trustkill Takeover Volume II"".  The second is a re-recorded version of the track ""Prelude To An Epic"" from their album ""Until the Ink Runs Out"".  The album has sold around 100,000+ copies in the U.S.  The album peaked at #74 in the U.S. ""Billboard"" chart. Off the Wall: Off the Wall is the fifth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, released on August 10, 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records.

It was released following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in ""The Wiz"".  While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album.

In the 14th century the original house of Dalberg became extinct in the male line, the fiefs passing to Johann Gerhard, chamberlain of the see of Worms, who married the heiress of his cousin, Anton of Dalberg, about 1330.  His own family was of great antiquity, his ancestors having been hereditary ministerials of the bishop of Worms since the time of Ekbert the chamberlain, who founded in 1119 the Augustinian monastery of Frankenthal and died in 1132.  By the mid 15th century the Dalberg family had grown to be of such importance that, in 1494, the German King Maximilian I granted them the honor of being the first to receive knighthood at the coronation; this part of the ceremonies being opened by the herald asking in a loud voice ""Ist kein Dalberg da?""  (""Is no Dalberg present?"") .  This picturesque privilege the family enjoyed till the end of the Holy Roman Empire.  The elder line of the family of Dalberg-Dalberg became extinct in 1848, the younger, that of Dalberg-Herrnsheim, in 1833.  The male line of the Dalbergs is now represented only by the family of Hessloch, descended from Gerhard of Dalberg (c. 1239), which in 1809 succeeded to the title and estates in Moravia and Bohemia of the extinct counts of Ostein. Order of Merit of the Italian Republic: The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italian: ""Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana"" ) was founded as the senior order of knighthood by the second President of the Italian Republic, Luigi Einaudi in 1951.  The highest ranking honour of the Republic, it is awarded for ""merit acquired by the nation"" in the fields of literature, the arts, economy, public service, and social, philanthropic and humanitarian activities and for long and conspicuous service in civilian and military careers.  The post-nominal letters for the order are OMRI.  The order effectively replaced as national orders the Civil Order of Savoy (1831), the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362). What You See Is What You Get (book): What You See Is What You Get is the autobiography of British businessman and TV personality Lord Alan Sugar.  The 640-page book, which was published in May 2011, tells the story of Alan Sugar's birth and childhood in a deprived part of London, how he founded the company Amstrad aged just 21 years old, and how he eventually became a successful multi-millionaire tycoon, received a knighthood, and was appointed to the House of Lords.  Sir Alan also reveals his main method of business and entrepreneurial activity: (a) observing what market leaders are doing, (b) making better and cheaper products than the market leaders, and (c) not focusing on the exclusive or more expensive parts of the market, rather selling to the mass market. Gino Cassinis: Gino Cassinis (27 January 1885 – 13 January 1964) was an Italian Democratic Socialist Party politician.  He was born in Milan.  He was mayor of Milan.  He was knight grand cross and grand officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.  He died in Rome. Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov): The Order of Saint Stanislaus (Polish: Order św.  Stanisława, Russian: Орденъ Св.  Станислава), also spelled Stanislas, is a Russian dynastic order of knighthood founded as ""Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr"" in 1765 by King Stanisław II Augustus of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  In 1831 after the downfall of the November Uprising, the order was incorporated into the Chapter of Russian Orders as part of the honours system of the Russian Empire by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.

The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress.  It is currently represented by Republican Tom Marino, who defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Carney during the 2010 U.S. House elections.  In 2006, the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control: in 2004, Republican Don Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later, Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53%–47% margin.  In 2008, Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010, electing Tom Marino.  The district is mostly Republican in its political composition, an aspect of the district that is reflected especially well in presidential elections.  In 2004, President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008, Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent.  Nonetheless, Carney easily won reelection as a Democrat the same year McCain won the district.  However, in the 2010 midterm elections, Marino unseated Carney by a 55%–45% margin.  In 2016, local business man and former mayor of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Mike Molesevich challenged Marino for the seat, but he fell to the Republican in November by more than two to one.  Marino remains the congressman in the 10th district, but he has expressed interest in a 2018 gubernatorial run rather than standing for reelection.

He used the garage behind his house on South Brown Street to work on automobiles and in April 1907 incorporated the Speedwell Motor Car Company.  Speedwell purchased and occupied a former Dayton Machine Tool Company factory on Essex Avenue in Dayton's Edgemont neighborhood, a site that later hosted a Delco factory.  The factory provided temporary space to the Wright Company in 1910 before the completion of its new airplane factory in west Dayton.  The Great Dayton Flood of 1913 inundated the Speedwell factory, destroying machinery and automobiles, and the company proved unable to recover and entered receivership in 1915.  Schenck later became president of the Dayton Malleable Iron Company and turned his focus to adapting high silicon iron alloys to practical uses.  This led to his establishing the Duriron Company, a name which he coined, in 1917.  It prospered through high demand for its products generated by the First World War and employed 1,500 people, becoming one of Dayton's leading industries.  His home at 414 Oakwood Avenue in Oakwood was designed by Dayton architect Albert Pretzinger in 1927. George Dayton (senator): George Dayton (born 1827, died 1938) lived in Union Township in what is now Rutherford, New Jersey, and represented Bergen County in the New Jersey Senate from 1875 to 1877.  Dayton moved to Closter, New Jersey, in 1890 and became the clerk of Harrington Township, New Jersey. George D. Dayton House: The George Draper Dayton House was built in 1890 in Worthington, Minnesota, United States.  George Dayton hired the Sioux Falls architect Wallace L. Dow to design his grand home on a parcel that took up eight lots. Bruce Dayton: Bruce Bliss Dayton (August 16, 1918 – November 13, 2015) was an American retail executive, businessman, and philanthropist.  Dayton was the last surviving of member of the five Dayton brothers – all grandsons of George Dayton, the founder of The Dayton Company – who expanded their grandfather's Dayton's department store in downtown Minneapolis from a single location into the national Target Corporation, one of the largest retail store chains in the United States.  Dayton served as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the company now known as the Target Corporation, before becoming the chairman of Dayton Hudson from 1970 to 1977. Dayton's: Dayton's was an American department store chain founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1902 by George Draper Dayton.  In 1969, the Detroit-based J.L. Hudson Company merged with the Dayton Company to form the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, adding 21 Michigan-based stores to the total.  In 1990, the department store division of Dayton–Hudson (now Target Corporation) acquired Chicago-based Marshall Field's.  Both Dayton's and Hudson's retained their individual store names until 2001, when they were united under the Marshall Field's nameplate.  Prior to changing its name to Marshall Field's, Dayton's stores numbered 19, serving communities throughout the upper Midwest. Target Corporation: Target Corporation is the second-largest discount store retailer in the United States, behind Walmart, and a component of the S&P 500 Index.  Founded by George Dayton and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was originally named Goodfellow Dry Goods in June 1902 before being renamed the Dayton's Dry Goods Company in 1903 and later the Dayton Company in 1910.  The first Target store opened in Roseville, Minnesota in 1962 while the parent company was renamed the Dayton Corporation in 1967.  It became the Dayton-Hudson Corporation after merging with the J.L. Hudson Company in 1969 and held ownership of several department store chains including Dayton's, Hudson's, Marshall Field's, and Mervyn's. B. Dalton: B. Dalton Bookseller (often called B. Dalton or B. Dalton's) was an American retail bookstore chain founded in 1966 by Bruce Dayton, a member of the same family that operated the Dayton's department store chain.  B. Dalton expanded to become the largest retailer of hardcover books in the United States, with 798 stores at the peak of the chain's success. Dayton–Wright Brothers Airport: Dayton–Wright Brothers Airport (IATA: MGY, ICAO: KMGY, FAA LID: MGY) is a public airport located 10 miles (16 km) south of the central business district of Dayton, Ohio, located mainly in Miami Township, Montgomery County and partly in Clearcreek Township, Warren County, near the suburb of Springboro.  It is owned and operated by the City of Dayton and serves as the reliever airport for Dayton International Airport.  It mainly serves corporate and personal aircraft users.

The lyrics of this anthem come from the poem ""Defence of Fort M'Henry"" written by Francis Scott Key.","The Star-Spangled Banner: ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is the national anthem of the United States of America.  The lyrics come from ""Defence of Fort M'Henry"", a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812.  Key was inspired by the large American flag, the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the American victory. Wilhelmus: Wilhelmus van Nassouwe, usually known just as the Wilhelmus (Dutch: ""Het Wilhelmus"" ; ] ; English translation: the ""William""), is the national anthem of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  It dates back to at least 1572, making it the oldest known national anthem in the world.  The national anthem of Japan, Kimigayo, has the oldest lyrics, dating from the 9th century.  However, a melody was added only in the late 19th century, making it a poem rather than an anthem for most of its lifespan.  Although the ""Wilhelmus"" was not recognised as the official national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status.  It was also the anthem of the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 1964. Arlette Roxburgh: Arlette Roxburgh is a Trinidadian American singer and songwriter.  She was born in Trinidad.  She is best known for singing The Star-Spangled Banner before every New Jersey Devils home game started.  When the Nets were in New Jersey, she also sang the national anthem before their home games at the time as well. New Jersey Devils: The New Jersey Devils are a professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey.  They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).  The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974.  The Scouts moved to Denver, Colorado in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies.  In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey and took their current name.  For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed to Continental Airlines Arena).  Beginning with the 2007–08 season, the Devils relocated to Newark and now play their home games at the Prudential Center. 1982–83 New Jersey Devils season: The 1982–83 New Jersey Devils season was the franchise's ninth season in the NHL and the first in New Jersey after moving from Denver, Colorado, where they were known as the Colorado Rockies.  The Devils first ever game was a 3-3 tie with the Pittsburgh Penguins, where first captain Don Lever scored the Devils' first ever goal.  The team's first win would come against their new rivals in the New York Rangers.  However, the new location didn't help the team overall, as they continued to struggle in the standings, finishing last in their division and third-to-last in their conference. Kongesangen: Kongesangen (""King's Song"") is Norway's royal anthem.  The lyrics come in several versions.  The first version (""Gud signe kongen vor"") was written by Henrik Wergeland, but the version used today and quoted below was written by Gustav Jensen for the coronation of Haakon VII and Maud of Wales in 1906.  It was inspired by the British royal and national anthem, and set to the tune of ""God Save the Queen"". Himno Nacional Mexicano: The ""Mexican National Anthem"" (Spanish: ""Himno Nacional Mexicano"" ), also known as ""Mexicans, at the cry of war"" (Spanish: ""Mexicanos, al grito de guerra"" ), is the national anthem of the United Mexican States.  The anthem was first used in 1854, although it was not officially adopted ""de jure"" until 1943.  The lyrics of the national anthem, which allude to historical Mexican military victories in the heat of battle and including cries of defending the homeland, were composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra after a Federal contest in 1853.  Later, in 1854, he asked Jaime Nunó to compose the music which now accompanies González's poem.  The anthem, consisting of ten stanzas and a chorus, effectively entered into use on September 16, 1854. List of New Jersey Devils seasons: The New Jersey Devils are a professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey.

Before that, the franchise entered the league as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974.  The 2010–11 season is the 29th season of play in New Jersey.  It is the 37th year for the Devils franchise, and including the team's time in Kansas City and Denver, the Devils have won over 1100 regular season games, 17th overall in NHL history. Jeffrey Vanderbeek: Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Vanderbeek is the former owner of the New Jersey Devils, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League.

In 2004, he bought the team outright and resigned his position as an executive vice president of Lehman Brothers, which he joined in 1984.  He was ranked the ninth highest paid executive of 2002 by ""Business Week"" with pay totaling over $29 million.  Vanderbeek has been a strong proponent of the Prudential Center, which hosted its first New Jersey Devils hockey game on October 27, 2007.  He resides in Warren Township, New Jersey, having previously resided in South Orange, New Jersey.

The company that manufactured PDQ Chocolate is a registered trademark of what company?,Ovaltine,Ovaltine,Ovaltine,I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct answer is that PDQ Chocolate was manufactured by Ovaltine. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.,The company that manufactured PDQ Chocolate is Ovaltine.,Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The company that manufactured PDQ Chocolate is Ovaltine.,"Ovaltine: Ovaltine (Ovomaltine) is a brand of milk flavoring product made with malt extract (except in the blue packaging in the United States), sugar (except in Switzerland), and whey.  Some flavors also have cocoa.  Ovaltine, a registered trademark of Associated British Foods, is made by Wander AG, a subsidiary of Twinings which acquired the brand from Novartis in 2002, except in the United States where Nestlé acquired the rights separately from Novartis later on. Washlet: Washlet (ウォシュレット , Woshuretto ) is a registered trademark of the Japanese toilet company Toto, referring to electric toilet seats with water spray feature for genital and anal cleansing.  It falls into the category of ""electronic bidets"" and is commonplace on toilets in Japan.  Released in June 1980, a total of more than 30 million washlets have been sold by January 2011.  Washlets have a large share in the cleansing toilet seats market and are so well-known that similar products from other toilet manufacturers like LIXIL (“shower toilet”) are also colloquially referred to as washlets, even though “washlet” is a registered trademark of Toto. Charactron: Charactron was a U.S. registered trademark (number 0585950, 23 February 1954) of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation (Convair) for its shaped electron beam cathode ray tube.  Charactron CRTs performed functions of both a display device and a read-only memory storing multiple characters and fonts.  The similar Typotron was a U.S. registered trademark (23 November 1953) of Hughes Aircraft Corporation for its type of shaped electron beam storage tube with a direct-view bistable storage screen. Service mark symbol: The service mark symbol (℠), the letters ""SM"" in superscript style) is a symbol used in the United States to provide notice that the preceding mark is a service mark.  This symbol has some legal force, and is typically used for service marks not yet registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; registered service marks are instead marked with the same symbol used for registered trademarks, the registered trademark symbol ®.  The proper manner to display the symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style. Ugg boots trademark dispute: Ugg boots trademark disputes are the disputes between some footwear manufacturers, as to whether ""ugg"" is a protected trademark, or a generic term and thus ineligible for trademark protection.  In Australia and New Zealand, where ""Ugg"" is a generic term for the style of footwear, 81 registered trademarks include the term ""Ugg"" in various logos and designs.  By contrast, UGG is a registered trademark of the California-based company Deckers Outdoor Corporation in over 130 countries worldwide, including the U.S., the European Union, and China. LaserWash: LaserWash is a brand name of a type of touchless in-bay automatic vehicle wash system, or car wash.  Sometimes used as a genericized trademark, especially in the United States, the name ""LaserWash"" is a registered trademark of PDQ Manufacturing.  LaserWash vehicle wash systems are manufactured in the United States and sold in over 40 countries. Trademark infringement: Trademark infringement is a violation of the exclusive rights attached to a trademark without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees (provided that such authorization was within the scope of the licence).  Infringement may occur when one party, the ""infringer"", uses a trademark which is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers.  An owner of a trademark may commence civil legal proceedings against a party which infringes its registered trademark.  In the United States, the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 criminalized the intentional trade in counterfeit goods and services. US-Arab Chamber of Commerce: US Arab Chamber of Commerce (USACC) is a nonprofit organization, headquartered in Washington DC to strengthen the bilateral trade relations between the United States and the Arab states.  USACC is a registered trademark in the United States and registered under the federal law with serial number: 77219861, on 10th February 2009.  The trademark was published for opposition in the United States Patent and Trademark Office monthly magazine on 25th November 2008. PDQ Chocolate: PDQ Chocolate was a popular drink mix in the 1960s and 1970s.  It was manufactured by Ovaltine.  It has been sold as ""PDQ Chocolate Flavor Beads"" and ""PDQ Choco Chips.""  ""Egg Nog Flavored PDQ"" and ""Strawberry PDQ"" were also available.  These flavored beads and chips were used to mix with milk or to sprinkle over ice cream. Registered trademark symbol: The registered trademark symbol (®) is a symbol that provides notice that the preceding word or symbol is a trademark or service mark that has been registered with a national trademark office.  A trademark is a symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product.  In some countries it is against the law to use the registered trademark symbol for a mark that is not officially registered in any country.

The new ship was launched on 9 April 1921, and made her maiden voyage on 25 May 1922 from Southampton to New York City.  At the outbreak of World War II she was converted into an Armed Merchant Cruiser, and subsequently a troopship.  Like her predecessor, sunk during the First World War, this ""Laconia"" was also destroyed by a German submarine.  Some estimates of the death toll have suggested that over 1,649 people were killed when the ""Laconia"" sank.  The U-boat commander Werner Hartenstein then staged a dramatic effort to rescue the passengers and the crew of ""Laconia"", which involved additional German U-boats and became known as the Laconia incident. RMS Laconia (1911): RMS ""Laconia"" was a Cunard ocean liner built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson, launched on 27 July 1911, delivered to the Cunard Line on 12 December 1911, and began service on 20 January 1912.

She was launched on 21 April 1913 and sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 30 May 1914.  ""Aquitania"" was the third in Cunard Line's ""grand trio"" of express liners, preceded by RMS ""Mauretania"" and  , and was the last surviving four-funnelled ocean liner.  Widely considered one of the most attractive ships of her time, ""Aquitania"" earned the nickname ""Ship Beautiful"". RMS Mauretania (1906): RMS ""Mauretania"" was an ocean liner designed by Leonard Peskett and built by Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson for the British Cunard Line, and launched on the afternoon of 20 September 1906.  She was the world's largest ship until the completion of  in 1911 as well as the fastest until ""Bremen"" 's maiden voyage in 1929.  ""Mauretania"" became a favourite among her passengers.  After capturing the Eastbound Blue Riband on her maiden return voyage in December 1907, she claimed the Westbound Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing during her 1909 season.  ""Mauretania"" would hold both speed records for twenty years. Johanna Veenstra: Johanna Veenstra (1894–1933) was the first missionary of the Christian Reformed Church (CRC) to go to Nigeria.  She was born on Thursday, April 19, 1894, on Hopper Street in Paterson, New Jersey.  Her parents were William Veenstra, later a Christian Reformed pastor, and Cornelia Anna De Hoop.  In 1915 she was challenged by Karl Kumm of the Sudan United Mission (SUM) to be a missionary in Africa.  On October 2, 1919, she left New York City on the ""Mauretania"" for England; on December 31, 1919, she took another ship to Africa, arriving in Lagos in January 1920.  In February 1921, she arrived at her station in Lupwe, which is near Takum, now in Taraba State.  Two years later Johanna Veenstra assumed leadership of the work in Lupwe.  She was engaged primarily in medical work and in preaching.  During her ministry in Lupwe, a number of people especially of the Kuteb people became Christian and also became more educated.  The roots of the Christian Reformed Church of Nigeria (CRCN) and the Reform Church of Christ in Nigeria (RCCN) Headquarters in Takum, Taraba State Nigeria lay in part in the work of Johanna Veenstra. Leonard Peskett: Leonard Peskett, OBE (1861 – 1924) was the Cunard Line's Senior naval architect and Designer and the designer of the companies ocean liners RMS Mauretania, RMS Lusitania, RMS Aquitania, and the RMS Carmania.

The name Cipher actually refers to two things: a powerful extra-dimensional glyph (tattoo) that confers superhuman powers on a sentient being, and the name of the being that wields the glyph.  Cipher is a new superhuman created by Warren Ellis and Salvador Larroca who were inspired by the original Spitfire and the nature of the Star Brand itself (as an extra-dimensional tool of near-unlimited power), combined with strong conceptual ties to Iron Man.

Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period.  The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the ""Captain America"" comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953.  Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication. Namor: Namor the Sub-Mariner ( ) (Namor McKenzie) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  Debuting in early 1939, the character was created by writer-artist Bill Everett for Funnies Inc., one of the first ""packagers"" in the early days of comic books that supplied comics on demand to publishers looking to enter the new medium.  Initially created for the unreleased comic ""Motion Picture Funnies Weekly"", the Sub-Mariner first appeared publicly in ""Marvel Comics"" #1 (cover-dated Oct. 1939) – the first comic book from Timely Comics, the 1930s–1940s predecessor of the company Marvel Comics.  During that period, known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic Books, the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely's top three characters, along with Captain America and the original Human Torch.  Everett said the character's name was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem, ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"".  Everett came up with ""Namor"" by writing down noble sounding names backwards and thought Roman/Namor looked the best.

October 16, 1929, Cluj) is a Romanian quantum physicist, member of the Romanian Academy since 1974.  He made fundamental contributions to quantum theories of electromagnetic interactions with atoms.  His parents were Ion and Florica Gavrilă (née Vișoiu).  His father taught medicine and his mother taught English at the University of Cluj. Mabel Murphy Smythe-Haith: Born in Montgomery, Alabama on April 3, 1918, Mabel Murphy Smythe-Haith was the daughter of Josephine Dibble and Henry Saunders Murphy.  She had two older sisters and a younger brother.  Both her parents were college educated and actively involved in the world of education.  Her father began his career teaching at what is now Langston University.  He later moved to what is now Alabama State where he stayed for several years before he accepted a job with the Standard Life Insurance Company to organize and run their printing division.  Her mother spent a year as the dean of women at Fort Valley State College in Atlanta, Georgia before becoming a “university hostess” at Atlanta University where she also served as the president of Alumni Association for twenty-two years.  Smythe-Haith enrolled in Spelman College when she was 15 but transferred to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts to complete her bachelor's degree.

""No Words"" actually appeared on the album ""Band on the Run,"" which was the third post-Beatles album by Paul McCartney and Wings. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.","Band on the Run: Band on the Run is the third studio album by Paul McCartney and Wings, released in December 1973.  It marked the fifth album by Paul McCartney since his departure from the Beatles in April 1970.  Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles – ""Jet"" and ""Band on the Run"" – such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia; in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing.  It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works. Waterfalls (Paul McCartney song): ""Waterfalls"" is a Paul McCartney ballad from his first solo album after Wings, ""McCartney II"".  The song has a stripped-down sound, with McCartney only playing a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a synthesizer and singing, and a short solo most likely played on an acoustic guitar.  It was released as a single with ""Check My Machine"" as its B-Side and reached chart position #9 in the UK.  In the US, however, it was his first single ever to miss the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart, only reaching number 106 despite being the follow-up to the number one hit ""Coming Up"".  In 2013, ""Rolling Stone"" rated it the #25 all-time Paul McCartney post-Beatles song, describing how it contrasted with Wings' prior single. Press to Play: Press to Play is the sixth post-Beatles studio album by the English musician Paul McCartney (outside of Wings' body of work), released in August 1986.  It was McCartney's first album of entirely new music since ""Pipes of Peace"" in 1983, and his first solo album to be issued internationally by EMI following a six-year alliance with Columbia Records in the United States and Canada.  Keen to re-establish himself after his poorly received 1984 musical film ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"", McCartney enlisted producer Hugh Padgham to give the album a contemporary sound. MPL Communications: MPL Communications (which stands for McCartney Productions Ltd.) is the holding company for the business interests of Paul McCartney.  In addition to handling McCartney's post-Beatles work, MPL is one of the world's largest privately owned music publishers through its acquisition of numerous other publishing companies.  MPL is based in London and New York City. Girlfriend (Paul McCartney song): ""Girlfriend"" is a song written by Paul McCartney.  McCartney thought of the song as one that Michael Jackson might like to record, and mentioned this to Jackson at a party in Hollywood.  Jackson had stated in interviews with the music press in the 1970s that he was a fan of The Beatles and the chance to record a McCartney original helped to inspire his next project.  However, McCartney ended up recording it himself with his band Wings, and it was issued in 1978 on the album ""London Town"".  Subsequently, it was suggested by Quincy Jones as a possible track for Jackson to record for his 1979 album ""Off the Wall"".  Jones was unaware that the song had been written for Jackson in the first place.  Jackson's recording omitted the middle eight heard in McCartney's version.  It was issued exclusively in the UK in 1980, as the fifth and final single from the ""Off the Wall"" album.  This proved to be another hit single for Jackson and one of his first recordings of a Paul McCartney song. Kisses on the Bottom: Kisses on the Bottom is the fifteenth post-Beatles studio album by Paul McCartney (discounting his Wings-era discography, his orchestral works and his output as the Fireman), consisting primarily of covers of traditional pop music and jazz.  Released in February 2012 on Starbucks' Hear Music label, it was McCartney's first studio album since ""Memory Almost Full"" in 2007.  The album was produced by Tommy LiPuma and includes just two original compositions by McCartney: ""My Valentine"" and ""Only Our Hearts"".  The former features Eric Clapton on guitar, while the latter features Stevie Wonder on harmonica.  ""Kisses on the Bottom"" peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and number 5 on the US ""Billboard"" 200, while also topping ""Billboard"" magazine's Jazz Albums chart. Temporary Secretary: ""Temporary Secretary"" is a song by Paul McCartney, featured on his 1980 album ""McCartney II"".  In 2013, ""Rolling Stone"" ranked it the #36 all-time McCartney post-Beatles song, calling it a ""cult favorite"" and an ""oddly catchy electro-pop nugget, about a slightly creepy-sounding guy looking to hire a temp.""  In 2014, ""Temporary Secretary"" was ranked the 167th greatest song of all time by critics of ""NME"" magazine.  They described it as ""wonky electropop that didn't sound so much ahead of its time as out of it altogether."" Wings Greatest: Wings Greatest is a compilation album by Wings and is their eighth album as well as Paul McCartney's 10th since leaving the Beatles.  It is notable as being the first official retrospective release from McCartney's post-Beatles career.  Excepting interest in its vinyl LP mix, this collection has been superseded by the releases of ""All the Best! "", """" and ""Pure McCartney"". No Words: ""No Words"" is a song written by Paul McCartney and Denny Laine, and first released on 7 December 1973 on ""Band on the Run"" by Paul McCartney and Wings.  The song was Laine's first co-writing on a Wings album and his only writing credit on ""Band on the Run"". Venus and Mars (Wings album): Venus and Mars is the fourth studio album by Wings.  Released in 1975 as the follow-up to the successful ""Band on the Run"", ""Venus and Mars"" continued Wings' string of success and would prove a springboard for a year-long worldwide tour.  It was Paul McCartney's first post-Beatles album to be released worldwide on the Capitol Records label.

All but the economics prize were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation.  The Nobel prize in Economics, or The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for outstanding contributions in the field of Economics.  Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. List of Danish Nobel laureates: This is a list of Danish Nobel laureates.  Since the Nobel Prize was established per the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel in 1895, 12 of the prize winners have been from Denmark.  The first Danish Nobel laureate was Niels Ryberg Finsen, who won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1903 for his work in using light therapy to treat diseases.  The most recent Danish Nobel Prize winner was Jens Skou who won the prize in chemistry for his discovery over the enzyme, Na+/K+-ATPase in 1997.  To date, of the 13 Nobel Prizes won by Danish people, 5 have been for medicine, 3 have been for physics, 3 have been for literature, 1 has been for chemistry and one has been for peace. Aage Bohr: Aage Niels Bohr (] ; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater ""for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection"".  Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.  Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Luis Walter Alvarez: Luis Walter Alvarez (June 13, 1911 – September 1, 1988) was an American experimental physicist, inventor, and professor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968.  The American Journal of Physics commented, ""Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century."" Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin"" ), administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine.  It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will.  Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories.  The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award.  The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal. Nobel Prize in Literature: Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i litteratur"" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: ""den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning"").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here ""work"" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Abdus Salam: Mohammad Abdus Salam {'1': "", '2': "", '3': 'NI, SPk, KBE', '4': ""} (Punjabi, Urdu: ‎ ; ] ; 29 January 192621 November 1996), was a Pakistani theoretical physicist.  A major figure in 20th century theoretical physics, he shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the electroweak unification theory.  He was the first Pakistani and first Muslim to receive a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize (after Anwar Sadat of Egypt). List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin"" ) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists and doctors in the various fields of physiology or medicine.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.  As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary elected by the Karolinska Institute.  While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for ""physiology or medicine"" in his will.  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields.  The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.  Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.  In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008.  In 2013, the prize was awarded to James E. Rothman, Randy W. Schekman and Thomas C. Südhof; they were recognised ""after discovering how cells precisely transport material"".  The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Nobel Prize in Physics: The Nobel Prize in Physics (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i fysik"" ) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Alvarezsauroidea: Alvarezsauroidea is a group of small maniraptoran dinosaurs. Alvarezsauroidea, Alvarezsauridae, and Alvarezsauria are named for the historian Don Gregorio Alvarez, not the more familiar physicist Luis Alvarez, who proposed that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact event.  The group was first formally proposed by Choiniere and colleagues in 2010, to contain the family Alvarezsauridae and non-alvarezsaurid alvarezsauroids, such as ""Haplocheirus"", which is the basalmost of the Alvarezsauroidea (from the Late Jurassic, Asia).  The discovery of ""Haplocheirus"" extended the stratigraphic evidence for the group Alvarezsauroidea about 63 million years further in the past.  The division of Alvarezsauroidea into the Alvarezsauridae and the non-alvarezsaurid alvarezsauroids is based on differences in their morphology, especially in their hand morphology.

It is the basic unit of local government. Essex Junto: The Essex Junto was a powerful group of New England Federalist Party lawyers, merchants, and politicians, so named because many of the original group were from Essex County, Massachusetts.  The term was coined by John Hancock in 1778 to describe the main opponents of a proposed constitution for the state of Massachusetts.  The proposed constitution was rejected by the people; the state adopted its constitution in 1780.  John Adams is also frequently credited with disseminating the name.  Over the following years the group expanded to include politicians from other New England states who were opposed to Democratic-Republican Party policies that dominated national politics. Lawrence, Massachusetts: Lawrence is a city in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, on the Merrimack River.  As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,377, which had risen to an estimated 78,197 as of 2014.  Surrounding communities include Methuen to the north, Andover to the southwest, and North Andover to the southeast.  Lawrence and Salem are the county seats of Essex County.  Lawrence is part of the Merrimack Valley. Essex County Airport: Essex County Airport (IATA: KCDW, ICAO: CDW) , informally ""Caldwell Airport"", is a public use airport located in Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey, two nautical miles (4 km) north of the central business district of Caldwell, a borough of northwestern Essex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey.  It is owned by the Essex County Improvement Authority.  This facility is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation ""reliever airport"". Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact: The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is an agreement among the six New England states to support the farm price of milk used for fluid consumption at a higher level than under federally mandated minimum prices in the region.  From 1997 until its expiration on September 30, 2001, the Northeast compact required processors in the region to pay dairy farmers at least $16.94/cwt.  for farm milk used for fluid consumption.  The law allowed membership in the compact to expand to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, if the prospective state was contiguous to a member state, and if the compact was approved by the state legislature of the prospective state and the U.S. Congress.  Although many states expressed interest in joining the compact or forming a separate compact, no congressional approval was granted beyond the six New England states, because of strong opposition from Upper Midwest dairy farmers and dairy processors.  The dairy compact has been replaced with Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) payments under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1502), which mandates direct federal payments to all participating dairy farmers nationwide when the minimum price for fluid farm milk in the Northeast falls below $16.94 per cwt. New England District (LCMS): The New England District is one of the 35 districts of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), and encompasses all six New England states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.  In addition, three in southwest Connecticut are in the non-geographic SELC District.  The New England District includes approximately 70 congregations and missions, subdivided into 9 circuits, as well as 24 preschools and 5 elementary schools.  Baptized membership is over 22,000; with New England's total population standing at 14,240,000 as of 2005, the District's membership represents only 0.16% of the local population – the lowest of any of the LCMS' 33 geographical districts. Climate of Massachusetts: a humid continental climate, with warm summers and cold, snowy winters.  Massachusetts is a state located in the New England region of the northeastern United States.  Most of its population of 6.4 million live in the Boston metropolitan area.  The eastern half of this relatively small state is mostly urban and suburban.  Massachusetts is the most populous of the six New England states and ranks third in overall population density and fourth by GDP per capita.  Massachusetts receives about 50 inches (1016 mm) of rain annually, fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, slightly wetter during the winter.  Summers are warm with average high temperatures in July above 80 °F (26.7 °C) and overnight lows above 60 °F (15.5 °C) common throughout the state.  Winters are cold, but generally less extreme on the coast with high temperatures in the winter averaging above freezing even in January, although areas further inland are much colder.  The state does have extreme temperatures from time to time with 90 °F (32.2 °C) in the summer and temperatures below 0 °F (-17.8 °C) in the winter not being unusual. 2003 NECBL season: The 2003 NECBL season marked the tenth season of the existence of the New England Collegiate Baseball League.  The league expanded to thirteen teams with the addition of the Vermont Mountaineers of Montpelier, Vermont.  The franchise was the league's first in the New England state of Vermont.  This marked the fulfillment of the league's goal of having a franchise in each of the six New England states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Andover, Massachusetts: Andover is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States.  It was settled in 1642 and later incorporated in 1646.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 33,201.  It is part of the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, Massachusetts-New Hampshire metropolitan statistical area. New England town: The New England town (generally referred to simply as a town in New England) is the basic unit of local government and local division of state authority in each of the six New England states and without a direct counterpart in most other U.S. states.  New England towns overlay the entire area of a state, similar to civil townships in other states where they exist, but they are fully functioning municipal corporations, possessing powers similar to cities in other states.  New Jersey's system of equally powerful townships, boroughs, towns, and cities is the system which is most similar to that of New England.  New England towns are often governed by a town meeting legislative body.  The great majority of municipal corporations in New England are based on the town model; statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon, though they are prevalent elsewhere in the U.S. County government in New England states is typically weak at best, and in some states nonexistent.  Connecticut, for example, has no county governments, ",cities,"[3112, 2017, 11, 7559, 304, 64158, 6406, 11, 22108, 11, 374, 459, 3187, 315, 264, 6913, 5089, 315, 2254, 3109, 323, 2254, 13096, 315,

He is the lead singer, occasional backing vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, theremin player and songwriter for the band the Flaming Lips. Clues (Robert Palmer album): Clues is the sixth solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1980.  It has a rockier, new wave edge compared to his previous releases.  The album peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart and No. 31 in the UK in 1980.  The album also peaked at No. 1 in Sweden, No. 3 in France, No. 15 in the Netherlands and No. 42 in Italy.

Zaireeka: Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by the alternative rock band The Flaming Lips.  Released on October 28, 1997, the experimental rock album consists of four Compact Discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD.  The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound.  The discs can also be played in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs.  The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: ""Zaire"", chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and ""eureka"" (literally: ""I have found it""), an expression of joyous discovery. Very Best of Robert Palmer: Very Best of Robert Palmer is a 1995 compilation album by British singer Robert Palmer.  Re-issued in 1997 with the addition of ""Addicted To Love '97"". Paleocontinent: A paleocontinent or palaeocontinent is a distinct area of continental crust that existed as a major landmass in the geological past.  There have been many different landmasses throughout Earth’s time.  They range in sizes, some are just a collection of small microcontinents while others are large conglomerates of crust.  As time progresses and sea levels rise and fall more crust can be exposed making way for larger landmasses.  The continents of the past shaped the evolution of organisms on Earth and contributed to the climate of the globe as well.  As land masses break apart species are separated and that were once the same now have evolved to their new climate.  The constant movement of these landmasses greatly determines the distribution of organisms on the Earth’s surface.  This is evident with how similar fossils are found on completely separate continents.  Also, as continents move, mountain building events (orogenies) occur, causing a shift in the global climate as new rock is exposed and then there is more exposed rock at higher elevations.  This causes glacial ice expansion and an overall cooler global climate.  Which effects the overall global climate trend of the Earth.  The movement of the continents greatly affects the overall dispersal of organisms throughout the world and the trend in climate throughout the Earth’s history.  Examples include Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia, which collided together during the Caledonian orogeny to form the Old Red Sandstone paleocontinent of Laurussia.  Another example includes a collision that occurred during the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian time when there was a collision between the two continents of Tarimsky and Kirghiz-Kazakh.  This collision was caused because of their askew convergence when the paleoceanic basin closed. La France a un incroyable talent: La France a un incroyable talent (English: France has incredible talent ), previously known as Incroyable Talent is a French television programme, based on the Got Talent series.  It debuted on M6 on 2 November 2006, presented by Alessandra Sublet. Gummy Song Fetus: Gummy Song Fetus is a three-track EP consisting of a USB drive embedded inside a gummy fetus.  It was first hand-delivered to Love Garden record store in Lawrence, Kansas by Wayne Coyne before its official release date of June 25, 2011, where the early gummy fetuses sold out quickly.  Being that the gummy fetuses are smaller than the $150 Gummy Skulls released previously in April 2011, they were originally priced at $30, as opposed to the former's price.  Songs were recorded at Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York, Steven's computer, Michael's musical M.A.S.H., and Wayne's house in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, March–May 2011.

Which happened first Battle of Okinawa or Operation Nordwind ?,Battle of Okinawa,Battle of Okinawa,Battle of Okinawa,The Battle of Okinawa happened before Operation Nordwind.,The Battle of Okinawa happened before Operation Nordwind.,"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The Battle of Okinawa happened before Operation Nordwind. The Battle of Okinawa took place from April 1 to June 22, 1945, while Operation Nordwind occurred from December 31, 1944, to January 25, 1945.","Battle of Okinawa: The Battle of Okinawa (Japanese: 沖縄戦 , Hepburn: Okinawa-sen ) (Okinawan: 沖縄戦 , ""Uchinaa ikusa "" ), codenamed Operation Iceberg, was a major battle of the Pacific War fought on the island of Okinawa by United States Marine and Army forces against the Imperial Japanese Army and included the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific War during World War II, the April 1, 1945, invasion of Okinawa itself.  The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945.  After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Okinawa, a large island only 340 mi away from mainland Japan, as a base for air operations for the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands. Operation Nordwind: Operation North Wind (German: ""Unternehmen Nordwind"" ) was the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front.  It began on 31 December 1944 in Alsace and Lorraine in northeastern France, and ended on 25 January. Ouvrage Simserhof: Ouvrage Simserhof is a ""gros ouvrage"" of the Maginot Line, located near the community of Sierstal in the French ""département"" of Moselle.  Simserhof is adjoined by ""petit ouvrage"" Rohrbach and ""gros ouvrage"" Schiesseck, and faces the German frontier.  Located 4 km to the west of Bitche, the ""ouvrage"" derived its name from a nearby farm.  It was a part of the Fortified Sector of Rohrbach.  During the Battle of France in 1940, Simserhof supported its neighboring fortifications with covering artillery fire, with partial success.  After the surrender of France, it was occupied by the Germans as a storage depot for torpedoes, and later resisted the American advances of late 1944.  Taken by the Americans, it was briefly re-occupied by the Germans during Operation Nordwind.  Following the war it was repaired for use by the French Army, but was proposed as a museum of the Maginot Line as early as the 1960s.  Retained by the Ministry of Defense, Simserhof now functions as a museum, and has the most extensive visitor infrastructure of any of the preserved Maginot fortifications. 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion: The 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War.  It was activated in April 1942 as a segregated African American unit, deploying to Europe at the end of 1944 and attached to 12th Armored Division.  It saw action during Operation Nordwind in January 1945, where elements of the battalion performed creditably.  However, its overall combat record was marred by severe disciplinary problems and insufficient training.  It was withdrawn in February, and assigned to rear-area duties; while it nominally remained active for the remainder of the war, it had been effectively disbanded. Order of battle for Operation Nordwind: This is the order of battle of German and Allied forces during Operation Nordwind in World War II Herrlisheim: Herrlisheim is a commune in the Bas-Rhin department in Grand Est in north-eastern France.  The town dates from the 8th century.  Herrlisheim was the scene of very heavy fighting during ""Operation Nordwind"", an offensive launched by the German Army during World War II that inflicted considerable damage to the town. Operation Zahnarzt: Operation Zahnarzt (literally ""Dentist"") was a plan by the Germans to eliminate the Third Army during World War II.  The plan of Operation Zahnarzt was to immediately come after Operation Nordwind.  The plan was to initiate a pincer movement to encircle and destroy the 3rd US Army. Fortified Sector of Rohrbach: The Fortified Sector of Rohrbach (""Secteur Fortifié de Rohrbach"") was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line in the vicinity of Bitche.  The sector was bordered to the west by the Fortified Sector of the Sarre and to the east by the Fortified Sector of the Vosges.  With lower priority than other sectors, the SF Rohrbach was built somewhat later than its neighbors to the east and west, and in company with positions on the extreme western end of the Maginot Line, became one of the ""New Fronts.""  The sector contains several major ""ouvrages"" and was the scene of fighting in both 1940 and 1944.  It was attacked in 1940 by German forces in the Battle of France.  The sector was heavily engaged by German forces in mid-June 1940, with several casemates and the ""petit ouvrage"" Welschhof surrendering before the Second Armistice at Compiègne.  The remaining positions and their garrisons finally surrendered on 27 June 1940.  In 1944 German forces occupied several positions in the SF Rohrbach, forcing advancing American forces to attack them individually or to bypass them.  The German Operation Nordwind offensive of early 1945 caused American forces to fall back, returning to complete the capture of the Rohrbach sector in March 1945.  Following the war many positions were reactivated for use during the Cold War.  Two locations are now preserved and open to the public. Colmar Pocket: The Colmar Pocket (French: ""Poche de Colmar"" ; German: ""Brückenkopf Elsaß"" ) was the area held in central Alsace, France, by the German Nineteenth Army from November 1944 to February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group during World War II.  It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace.  During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace.  In late January and early February 1945, the French First Army (reinforced by the U.S. XXI Corps) cleared the Pocket of German forces. MYH16 gene: The MYH16 gene encodes a protein called myosin heavy chain 16 which is a muscle protein in mammals.  At least in primates, it is a specialized muscle protein found only in the temporalis and masseter muscles of the jaw.  Myosin heavy chain proteins are important in muscle contraction, and if they are missing, the muscles will be smaller.  In non-human primates, MYH16 is functional and the animals have powerful jaw muscles.  In humans, the MYH16 gene has a mutation which causes the protein not to function.  Although the exact importance of this change in accounting for differences between humans and other apes is not yet clear, such a change may be related to increased brain size and finer control of the jaw which facilitates speech.  It is not clear how the MYH16 mutation relates to other changes to the jaw and skull in early human evolution (for example, whether the MYH16 mutation happened first and led to other changes, or whether the MYH16 mutation happened after other changes made the MYH16 protein no longer necessary).

Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables, but they are perhaps best known as sauces for pasta dishes. Louisiana Hot Sauce: Louisiana Hot Sauce is a brand of hot sauce manufactured in New Iberia, Louisiana by The Original Louisiana Hot Sauce Co., which is owned by Southeastern Mills Inc.  The product's labeling includes the word ""original"", and it is sometimes referred to as ""Original Louisiana Hot Sauce"" and ""Original Louisiana Brand Hot Sauce.""  It is a common hot sauce in the U.S. state of Louisiana.  Bruce Foods was the previous owner and manufacturer of the brand, and sold it to Southeastern Mills Inc. in April 2015. Skoda 100 mm Model 1916: The Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 (100 mm M.16) was a mountain howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I.  The Turks used a 105 mm variant, the M.16(T).  The Wehrmacht redesignated this as the 10 cm GebH 16 or 16(ö).  Guns acquired from Italy, after 1943, were known as 10 cm GebH 316(i); those acquired from Czechoslovakia were 10 cm GebH 16(t).  The Italians referred to weapons gained either through capture or reparations as the Obice da 100/17 modello 16.  The gun could be broken into three sections, intended for towing by two animal carts.  The gun crew was protected by a gun shield.  The Italians used lighter shells than the Czechs, which accounts for the greater range and muzzle velocity of their guns. Creole sauce: Creole sauce, also referred to as ""red gravy"", creole tomato sauce, and sauce piquant in New Orleans, is a Creole cuisine, Bahamian cuisine and New Orleans cuisine sauce made by sauteeing vegetables in butter and olive oil.  It is used in the American south and in the Bahamas.  It is made with tomatoes, the Cajun holy trinity (celery, bell peppers, and onions), garlic, seasonings, and herbs.  Stock (usually chicken) is also used and seasoned with cayenne, hot sauce, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, thyme, and parsley. Breton sauce: Breton sauce, (fr.  ""Sauce Bretonne"") is a French compound sauce consisting of a velouté base with julienned onion, leeks, celery heart and mushrooms, mounted with butter and cream.  It has been referred to as a brown version of ""Sauce soubise"" which has as its base a béchamel sauce. Michigan hot dog: A Michigan hot dog, or simply ""Michigan"", is a steamed hot dog on a steamed bun topped with a meaty sauce, generally referred to as ""Michigan sauce"".  The sauce may be tomato-based, depending on where the Michigan is purchased.  Michigans can be served with chopped onions.  If served with onions, the onions can either be buried under the sauce, under the hot dog itself, or sprinkled on top of the sauce. Italians of Ethiopia: Italians of Ethiopia are the emigrants and colonists from Italy who moved to live in Ethiopia as far back as the 19th century, and their descendants.  King Menelik II did not allow the sale of lands belonging to Ethiopia to Italians (Eritrea) and probably allowed France (Djibouti) to solidify his centralized power and have external trading partners.  There was a subsequent exchange of ideas, farming techniques, education and technology between the Italians and Ethiopians during most of this period, including transportation—most notably the Italian engineers who helped to architect an build the aqueducts and rail system for Ethiopia's railway system from the new capital, Addis Ababa to then French controlled Djibouti port.  However, the relationship was often marked by the fact that under various treaties written in both Amharic and Italian, the Italian version always referred to Ethiopia as a protectorate of Italy.  Most of the Italians moved to Ethiopia after the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936. Asmara under Italian rule: Asmara under Italian rule was a colonial period when Eritrea's capital was ruled by the Italians.  The city of Asmara came under Italian control in the 1880s after they conquered the territory of Italian Eritrea.  In 1897, it was made the capital of the territory.  The Italians subsequently referred to the city as ""Piccola Roma"". French sauce spoon: A French sauce spoon or saucier spoon is a spoon that is typically the size and shape of a dessert spoon, but with a flattened bowl that has a thinner edge and a small notch on one side.  As the name suggests, a French sauce spoon is used to eat the sauce accompanying a dish.  Such a spoon may be referred to simply as a sauce spoon, but this can also refer to a spoon used to serve sauce. BiFi: BiFi is an originally German brand of sausage-based snacks now owned by Link Snacks.  In the original version, it is a thin, jerky-like salami; variations include a poultry-based salami, a salami wrapped in a white or wheat roll (BiFi Roll and BiFi Roll Korn), a roll filled with beef, beans and bacon (Ranger), and a roll filled with salami, cheese, and pizza sauce (BiFi Carazza).

It was hosted by Brian Tracey and Dawn Hayes.  The show was produced at WCVB-TV by Jonathan Goodson Productions, and all of its games and its theme were virtually identical to the Illinois state lottery game show ""Illinois Instant Riches"" (later ""Illinois Luckiest""). List of six-number lottery games: A six-number lottery game, often having Megabucks, Pick-6, or Lotto as part of its name, is a form of lottery in which six numbers are drawn from a larger pool (for example, 6 out of 44).  Winning the top prize, usually a jackpot, requires a player to match all six regular numbers drawn; the order in which they are drawn is irrelevant.  Functionally, these games are similar to five-number games, except, because of the sixth number that needs to be matched, the top-prize odds usually are longer.  Therefore, six-number games generally offer a higher top prize.  Six-number games (using one drum) were the most popular kind of U.S. lottery game, before two-drum games such as Cash4Life and Mega Millions were created.  (These games also draw six numbers; however, five are from one set, while a sixth is drawn from a second pool.  These ""5+1"" games also require all six numbers to be matched for the top prize/jackpot.) Powerball: Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 44 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries.  Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead.  One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money. Hoosier Lottery: The Hoosier Lottery is the official state lottery of Indiana, and is the only US lottery that uses the state's nickname as its official name.  It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL).  The Hoosier Lottery sells scratch-off tickets; its draw games include Mega Millions, Hoosier Lotto, Powerball, Cash 5, and Poker Lotto. Lotto*America: Lotto*America was the first lottery game offered by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL).  It was replaced in 1992 by Powerball, which, along with Mega Millions, are MUSL's flagship games. Wintario: Wintario was the first lottery game offered by the Ontario Lottery Corporation in Ontario, Canada. TattsLotto: TattsLotto is a weekly lottery game played on Saturday nights in Australia.  The game is a product of Tatts Group and promoted under the master brand The Lott.  The first TattsLotto draw was televised by Melbourne television station HSV7 on 22 June 1972, and was hosted by David Johnston and Lucy Kiraly.  Six numbers and two supplementary numbers are drawn.  To play you choose six numbers between 1 and 45.  Winnings are calculated in 6 divisions with division 1 (six correct numbers) paying between 1 and 20 million dollars, however some New Years Megadraws can win up to 30 million dollars, if not more.  TattsLotto is a lottery game played across Australia but is known as Saturday Lotto in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, and Gold Lotto in Queensland.  It is drawn each Saturday night of the year and draws over $15 Million are telecast on Channel Seven in Melbourne, Prime in Southern NSW & Victoria, and the Seven Network & Network Ten affiliated Southern Cross Television in Tasmania. Mark Patrick: Mark Patrick Storen (born c. 1959), better known by his professional name Mark Patrick, is an American radio personality based in Indianapolis.  Starting out on satellite radio, he was part of MLB Network Radio as the co-host of ""Baseball This Morning"" along with Buck Martinez and Larry Bowa .  Patrick also hosted the Hoosier Lottery television game show Hoosier Millionaire for 14 years.  Patrick also had a nationally syndicated morning show on Fox Sports Radio for a few years.  Patrick was primary sports anchor for WISH-TV from 1990 to 1998. Cashola: Cashola, stylized ""Ca$hola"", was a video lottery game offered by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) from July 2006 to May 2011.  Cashola was the first US multi-jurisdictional video lottery game. Lotto 6/49: Lotto 6/49 is one of three national lottery games in Canada.  Launched on June 12, 1982, Lotto 6/49 was the first nationwide Canadian lottery game to allow players to choose their own numbers.  Previous national games, such as the Olympic Lottery, Loto Canada and Superloto used pre-printed numbers on tickets.  Lotto 6/49 led to the gradual phase-out of that type of lottery game in Canada.

His band was the first to fuse hillbilly hokum, jazz, and pop together into a unique, distinctly American hybrid, thus giving him the nickname, ""Father of Western Swing"".  The birthplace of Brown's upbeat ""hot-jazz hillbilly"" string band sound was developed at the Crystal Springs Dance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas from 1931 to 1936.  Brown's music inspired the great string jazz musicians from Europe, Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli who in 1935 formed the Hot Club de Paris quintet. Kabalas: The Kabalas were a four-piece band out of the Quad Cities area of the American Mid-West whose musical foundations were based firmly in a traditional Eastern European Klezmer style that mixed in Jewish folksongs, Israeli popular songs, Polka and popular music.  The members of the band were Scott Morschhauser (vocals, accordion, guitar, percussion); Barry ""The Wolfman"" Wolf (accordion); ""Nervous"" Neal Smith (saxophones, backup vocals, flute, clarinet); and the late ""Mr."" Joel Dick (drums, percussion).  On stage, their performance was a blend of vaudeville antics and great musicianship.  Their traditional closing song was ""Hey Lordy Mambo"" where the drummer would play with four sticks and set them on fire. Underground dance music: The term underground dance music (short version in music jargon: UDM) has been applied to artistic dance music movements, such as early 1970s disco and 1980s Chicago house, but the term has since then come to be defined by any electronic dance or house music artist/band that avoids becoming a trend/mainstream nowadays.  Other early ""underground dance music"" artists include Little Louie Vega, Tony Humphries, Larry Levan, David Mancuso, Frankie Knuckles, Nicky Siano, Lenties Deep and many others.  In the late 1970s, the term underground dance music was associated with the music initially played at places like Paradise Garage, The Loft and The Warehouse. Traditional Nordic dance music: Traditional Nordic dance music is a type of traditional music or folk music that once was common in the mainland part of the Nordic countries — Scandinavia plus Finland.  The person who plays this kind of music might be called ""speleman"" (Swedish/Norwegian), ""spelman"" (Swedish), ""spel(l)emann"" (Norwegian), ""pelimanni"" (Finnish) or ""spillemand"" (Danish).  Finnish traditional dance music is often called ""pelimanni music"" in English, while there does not seem to exist a similar, widespread term for the corresponding music from the other countries.  It is often more meaningful to distinguish between the traditional dance music from different regions than between music from the countries as such.  Some concepts in the field can be defined as Norwegian or Finnish, but most are either common to all four countries or local.  Besides the dance music tradition, all countries also have other traditions of folk music that are not shared to a similar extent. Music Inspired by Watership Down: Music Inspired by Watership Down is a progressive rock album by Swedish musician Bo Hansson.  The album is Hansson's fourth solo album and is, as its name suggests, built around musical ideas inspired by Richard Adams' heroic fantasy novel ""Watership Down"".  It was the second album of Hansson's to have been based on a novel; his first solo album, ""Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings"", had likewise been based on J. R. R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"".  Hansson had already composed and released a musical suite inspired by ""Watership Down"" on his previous album ""Attic Thoughts"".  However, beyond its title, the ""Music Inspired by Watership Down"" album contains few overt references to the novel and instead features excerpts from the works of various poets, such as John Keats and Alexander Pope. Mental Overdrive: Mental Overdrive is the primary solo moniker of Per Martinsen (born 31 July 1966), one of Norway's most prolific and influential techno musicians.  His tracks have ranged from hardcore rave techno to vibrant space-disco, and he's always maintained a healthy balance of humor and braininess.  Active since 1990, he began his career releasing several 12"" EPs of aggressive, rave-ready hardcore techno on revered Belgian label R&S, including 12000 AD (1990), The Second Coming (1991), Move!  (as Confusion Club, 1991), and The Love EP (1992).  In 1994, Martinsen began releasing atmospheric techno singles as part of Illumination, his duo with Nicholas Sillitoe.  The next year, Mental Overdrive released the single ""Disto Disco,"" which featured a B-side (""Faith"") co-written by R&S artist Outlander, best known for the 1991 classic ""Vamp.""  The A-side appeared on Mental Overdrive's full-length debut Plugged, released on Martinsen's own Love OD Communications.  The album showed a notable progression in his music, maintaining its rough, distorted hardcore techno sound while adding more cerebral elements, placing it closer to Warp's Artificial Intelligence series.  Martinsen displayed his sense of humor with 1996's Unplugged, a limited conceptual release containing silent ""versions"" of the tracks on Plugged.  083 In 1997, Mental Overdrive signed to Virgin and released About Jazz, a significantly more house/disco-influenced EP than his previous work.  This was followed by full-length Ad Absurdum, which continued in a more light-hearted and funky direction than his previous releases.  He took a few years off from releasing Mental Overdrive recordings, instead devoting time to Frost (his more pop-focused electronic duo with his wife Aggie Peterson) and Illumination, which released two albums on RCA.  Following the 2003 release of Mental Overdrive's Me EP on Love OD, he signed to Norwegian label Smalltown Supersound and released full-length 083, which featured the single ""Diskodans.""  In 2005, the label compiled his early R&S material on CD as The Phuture That Never Happened.  Two years later, Mental Overdrive's single ""Spooks"" appeared on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label.  The song appeared on his next Smalltown full-length, You Are Being Manipulated, which was released in 2008.  The album was perfectly at home with the label's other left-field dance artists like Bjørn Torske and Kim Hiorthøy, while maintaining the unique Mental Overdrive sound.  Martinsen continued releasing Mental Overdrive singles on Full Pupp and Love OD, and contributed to Rune Lindbæk's Meanderthals project.  In 2012, he released Man with a Movie Camera, an EP featuring music he'd composed for a 1996 screening of the Russian silent film of the same name, which also featured pieces by Biosphere which would later appear on the 2001 remaster of his classic album Substrata.  Mental Overdrive returned to his Love OD label for 2013 full-length Cycls, as well as 2014's Everything Is Connected, which compiled a few previously released EPs.  In 2016, Full Pupp sublabel Rett I Fletta released a new version of Plugged consisting of alternate takes sourced from the original DAT tapes.  (Paul Simpson for allmusic.com) Polka: The polka is originally a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas.  It originated in the middle of the 19th century in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic.  Polka remains a popular folk music genre in many European countries, and is performed by folk artists in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and to a lesser extent in Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Russia, and Slovakia.  Local varieties of this dance are also found in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latin America and the United States. The Send: The Send was an alternative rock project of Falling Up ex-guitarist, Joseph A. Kisselburgh of Albany, Oregon, currently signed to Tooth & Nail Records.  His debut album, ""Cosmos"", was released on July 31, 2007.  Before this was even released, though, his song, ""The Fall"", was featured on ""Charlotte's Web: Music Inspired By The Motion Picture"", a compilation album with music inspired by the 2006 movie of Charlotte's Web.  On June 23 The Send began a winter retreat with labelmate, Hawk Nelson, around Major League Baseball venues.  The first single off ""Cosmos"" was ""An Epiphany,"" which quickly gained some success, reaching No. 5 on Christian Hit Radio. Sick Individuals: Sick Individuals is a Dutch electronic dance music act consisting of Rinze ""Ray"" Hofstee and Joep ""Jim"" Smeele.  The two met in Hilversum, Netherlands (2008) while studying Music Composition.  Jim and Ray had been composing for television commercials until their mutual fascination for both classical and modern music inspired their business partnership in 2010, when Sick Individuals was born. Dance music: Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing.  It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement.  In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music.  While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances.  In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance).  In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing.  The waltz also arose later in the classical era.  Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.

Located in South Australia, the Barossa Valley is about 56 km (35 miles) northeast of the city of Adelaide.  Unlike most of Australia whose wine industry was heavily influenced by the British, the wine industry of the Barossa Valley was founded by German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of Silesia (in what is now Poland).  The hot continental climate of the region promoted the production of very ripe grapes that was the linchpin of the early Australian fortified wine industry.  As the modern Australian wine industry shifted towards red table wines (particularly those made by the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon) in the mid-20th century, the Barossa Valley fell out of favor due to its reputation for being largely a Syrah from producers whose grapes were destined for blending.  During this period the name ""Barossa Valley"" rarely appeared on wine labels.  In the 1980s, the emergence of several boutique families specializing in old vine Shiraz wines began to capture international attention for the distinctive style of Barossa Shiraz, a full bodied red wine with rich chocolate and spice notes.  This led to a renaissance in the Barossa Valley which catapulted the region to the forefront of the Australian wine industry. Act of 5th November: The Act of 5th November of 1916 was a declaration of Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria.  This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers.  The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia.  Even though the act itself expressed very little in concrete terms, its declaration is regarded as one of main factors in the Polish efforts to regain independence.  Despite official statements, the German Empire really planned to annex up to 35,000 km² of prewar Congress Poland, with ethnic cleansing of between 2 and 3 million Poles and Jews out of these territories to make room for German settlers. German Namibians: German Namibians (German: ""Deutschnamibier"" ) are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia.  In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought (from a local chief) what would become the southern coast of Namibia and founded the city of Lüderitz.  The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, naming it South West Africa (German: ""Deutsch-Südwestafrika"" ).  Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (German: ""Schutztruppe"" ), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials.  In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost Southwest Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former colony became a South African mandate.  The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory. The Outpost (Prus novel): The Outpost (Polish title: ""Placówka"") was the first of four major novels by the Polish writer Bolesław Prus.  The author, writing in a Poland that had been partitioned a century earlier by Russia, Prussia and Austria, sought to bring attention to the plight of rural Poland, which had to contend with poverty, ignorance, neglect by the country's upper crust, and colonization by German settlers backed by Otto von Bismarck's German government. German Guatemalan: A German Guatemalan is a citizen of Guatemala whose ancestors were German settlers (along with other settlers from Belgium) who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Guatemala had a massive immigration of Germans in the nineteenth century, the government of Justo Rufino Barrios these immigrants they were provided farmlands of coffee in the departments of Quetzaltenango, Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz, but by the early twentieth century came Germans in Guatemala City, Zacapa and Jutiapa, in these regions there are many descendants of these German people.  Guatemala currently has a strong community of Germans who make up the majority of European immigrants in the country, is also the most numerous German community in all Central American countries. Dakota Freie Presse: The Dakota Freie Presse (English: Dakota Free Press ), abbreviated DFP, was a weekly German language newspaper printed in Yankton, Dakota Territory (now South Dakota).  It circulated in the Dakotas and other states, Canada, and Europe, from 1874 to 1954.  The newspaper was non-denominational and neutral in politics.  The focus of the paper was on Germans from Russia; German settlers in Russian colonies around the Black Sea and, to a lesser degree, along the Volga River; and subsequent settlers in the Dakotas in the United States.  The ""Dakota Freie Presse"" was published first only in German, but it later began publishing in English. Otto von Bismarck: Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck (] ), was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890.  In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership.  With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace.  For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who ""remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers"".  However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France.  This helped set the stage for the First World War. Hegewald (colony): Hegewald was a short-lived German colony during World War II, situated near Zhytomyr in Reichskommissariat Ukraine.  It was repopulated in late 1942 and early 1943 by the ethnically German settlers classified as ""Volksdeutsche""; transferred from occupied territories of Poland, Croatia, Bessarabia, and the Soviet Union to an area earmarked for the projected Germanization of the Ukrainian lands.  The plans were prepared months in advance by the SS, RKFDV and VoMi, but major problems with supplies occurred right from the region's initial establishment.  Heinrich Himmler's original plans to recruit settlers from Scandinavia and the Netherlands were unsuccessful. List of heads of state of Poland: After the German conquest of Poland, a Polish government-in-exile was formed under the protection of France and Britain.  The President of the Republic and the government-in-exile were recognized by the United Kingdom and, later, by the United States until 6 July 1945, when the Western Allies accepted the Communist-led government backed by Stalin.  Despite having lost recognition by other governments, the government-in-exile continued in London until the election of Lech Wałęsa as President of the Republic of Poland in December 1990 - when it handed over its formal powers and the insignia of the Polish Second Republic to President-elect Walesa in a ceremony at the Warsaw Royal Castle on 22 December 1990. Abbas Ali Meerza: Syed Mohammed Abbas Ali Meerza (born 1942) is the heir of the last Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad.  He has been so since the Supreme Court of India declared him to be the lawful heir in August 2014.  The royal title had been in abeyance since the death of his maternal uncle Waris Ali Meerza (the third Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad) in 1969.  All the royal title such as Nawab have been abolished by the government of India in 1971.
