"Cadmium Chloride is slightly soluble in this chemical, it is also called what?",Water,Alcohol,Water,"I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. Based on the provided context, Cadmium Chloride is slightly soluble in water.",Cadmium Chloride is slightly soluble in ethanol.,Cadmium Chloride is slightly soluble in water.,"Cadmium chloride: Cadmium chloride is a white crystalline compound of cadmium and chlorine, with the formula CdCl.  It is a hygroscopic solid that is highly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol.  Although it is considered to be ionic, it has considerable covalent character to its bonding.  The crystal structure of cadmium chloride (described below), composed of two-dimensional layers of ions, is a reference for describing other crystal structures.  Also known are CdCl•HO and CdCl•5HO. Water blue: Water blue, also known as aniline blue, Acid blue 22, Soluble Blue 3M, Marine Blue V, or C.I. 42755, is a chemical compound used as a stain in histology.  Water blue stains collagen blue in tissue sections.  It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Diflucortolone valerate: Diflucortolone valerate (also ""Nerisone"" cream/oily cream/ointment, ""Neriderm"" ointment, Japanese ジフルコルトロン (Jifurucorutoron ) is a corticosteroid rated Class 2 ""potent"" (100-150 times) in the New Zealand topical steroid system.  It is a white to creamy white crystalline powder.  It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dichloromethane and in dioxan, sparingly soluble in ether and slightly soluble in methyl alcohol.  Chemically, it is a corticosteroid esterified with valeric acid.  It is commonly used topically in dermatology.  The brand name is Nerisone; its creams come in potencies of 0.1% and 0.3%. Heptanoic acid: Heptanoic acid, also called enanthic acid, is an organic compound composed of a seven-carbon chain terminating in a carboxylic acid.  It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor.  It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils.  It is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether. Magnesium chloride: Magnesium chloride is the name for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl and its various hydrates MgCl(HO).  These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water.  The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water.  In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine.  It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley.  Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe.  Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater.  Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale.  Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available. Ethanol: Ethanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol, is a compound and simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H5OH .  Its formula can be written also as CH3 −CH2 −OH or C2H5 −OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.  Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor.  It is used as a drug and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. Tributyltin oxide: Tributyltin oxide (TBTO) is an organotin compound chiefly used as a biocide (fungicide and molluscicide), especially a wood preservative.  Its chemical formula is <ce>[(C4H9)3Sn]2O</ce>.  It has the form of a colorless to pale yellow liquid that is only slightly soluble in water (20 ppm) but highly soluble in organic solvents.  It is a potent skin irritant. Benzamide: Benzamide is an off-white solid with the chemical formula of CHCONH.  It is a derivative of benzoic acid.  It is slightly soluble in water, and soluble in many organic solvents. Gold(III) chloride: Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine.  With the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl.  The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds.  There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl).  Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as ""gold chloride"" or ""acid gold trichloride"".  Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol.  It decomposes above 160 °C or in light. Chloride: The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl.  It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents.  Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water.  It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells.  Less frequently, the word ""chloride"" may also form part of the ""common"" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded.  For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.

The coup rendered powerless the democratically elected government of Yun Bo-seon and ended the Second Republic, installing a reformist military Supreme Council for National Reconstruction effectively led by Park, who took over as Chairman after General Chang's arrest in July.

Korea under Japanese rule: Korea under Japanese rule began with the end of the short-lived Korean Empire in 1910 and ended at the conclusion of World War II in 1945.  Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong.

In addition, he is a WTF-certified Master Instructor of Taekwondo and a Canadian National Referee (1st Class). United States in the Korean War: At the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.

Maurice's reign was dominated by his wars with Carlo I Tocco.  Maurice was able to defend his capital of Arta, but despite some victories failed to prevent the fall of Ioannina to Tocco.  As a result, his brother Yaqub Spata who succeeded him was defeated in October 1416, ending the Despotate of Arta. Hot Feet: Hot Feet is a jukebox musical featuring the music of Earth, Wind & Fire, a book by Heru Ptah and was conceived, directed, and choreographed by Maurice Hines.  The musical opened on Broadway at the Foxwoods Theatre (then the Hilton Theatre) on April 30, 2006 and closed on July 23, 2006. Thomas Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley: He was born to Sir Maurice Berkeley, ""de jure"" 3rd Baron Berkeley, and Isabel Meade, in England.  He was the younger brother to Maurice Berkeley, ""de jure"" 4th Baron Berkeley, and had a younger brother, James, and younger sister, Anne.  On 9 September 1513 he fought in the Battle of Flodden and was knighted by the Earl of Surrey, Thomas Howard.  He later became Constable of Berkeley Castle on 15 May 1514, and Sheriff of Gloucestershire, November 1522 - November 1523.  By writ, he was succeeded to the title of ""de jure"" 5th Baron Berkeley on 12 September 1523 after his brother Maurice's death, and his eldest son Thomas followed as the ""de jure"" 6th Baron Berkeley, again by writ. John Hines (Australian soldier): John ""Barney"" Hines (1873–1958) was a British-born Australian soldier of World War I, known for his prowess at collecting ""souvenirs"" from German soldiers.  Hines was the subject of a famous photo taken by Frank Hurley that depicted him surrounded by German military equipment and money he had looted during the Battle of Polygon Wood in September 1917.  This image is among the best-known Australian photographs of the war. Baron Berkeley of Stratton: Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in the County of Cornwall, was a title in the Peerage of England.  It was created in 1658 for John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, a Royalist supporter during the English Civil War, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family.  He was a descendant of Sir Maurice de Berkeley (14th century), younger son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (see Baron Berkeley).  Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge, was his brother and Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, his nephew.  Lord Berkeley of Stratton's second son, the third Baron (who succeeded his elder brother), was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.  He died without surviving children and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron.  He was a politician and served as First Lord of Trade between 1714 and 1715.  On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Baron.  He was also a politician and held office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-Pensioners.  He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1775. Baron Berkeley: The title Baron Berkeley originated as a feudal title and was subsequently created twice in the Peerage of England by writ.  It was first granted by writ to Thomas II de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245–1321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued.  The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron's nephew and heir James Berkeley.  His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488.  He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquesate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed ""de jure"" to his younger brother Maurice.  However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol.  Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs.  Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII's unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family.  Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were ""de jure"" barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming ""de facto"" 7th Baron in 1553.  Upon his death he was succeeded by his relative George Harding. Andrew Hines: Andrew Hines (born May 25, 1983 in Villa Park, California) is a five-time National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock Motorcycle champion.  He rides the flagship Screamin' Eagle/Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson V-rod.  Andrew follows in the footsteps of his brother and crew chief, Matt Hines (NHRA Champion 1996, 97, 98).

It was one of the first clubs to replace some of the 'red light' businesses on South First Street (across the street was the Pussycat Theater which later became F/X).  The Cactus Club took over The Bachelor Club and went on to become a legendary live music venue in San Jose for close to 15 years.  The concept of The Cactus Club was created by Sean Galvin and Mike Trippett.  It was Producer/Promoter Ric Hines who made the opening of the Cactus Club possible with his business experience and professional network.  Hines recruited a local lawyer as a partner, Bob Cullen, whose nickname ""Cactus Bob"" was used to name the club.  Mike's brother Calvin Trippett was brought in later as the booking agent for the club.  The Cactus Club opened in 1988 and remained open until 2002. Uptown... It's Hot!: Uptown...

The Bass Rock Lighthouse was next to what Castle?,No castle.,Unknown,Bass Rock Castle,Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The Bass Rock Lighthouse was next to an important castle on Bass Rock itself. The castle was used as a prison after the Commonwealth period.,"Apologies, but based on the information provided in the context, it does not specify which castle the Bass Rock Lighthouse was next to.","I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. After reviewing the given context, it appears that there is no mention of a specific castle next to the Bass Rock Lighthouse. The context only states that the Bass Rock was the site of an important castle, but there is no indication of its proximity to the lighthouse.","Split Rock Lighthouse State Park: Split Rock Lighthouse State Park is a state park of Minnesota on the North Shore of Lake Superior.  It is best known for the picturesque Split Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States.  Built by the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Minnesota Historical Society operates them as a museum.  The 2200 acre state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling. Baldred Rock: Baldred Rock ( ) is a rock in Fitchie Bay at Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands.  It lies close off the south side of Ferrier Peninsula, 0.75 nmi east-southeast of Graptolite Island.  This rock was mapped by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under William Speirs Bruce, 1902–04, and was later named ""Bass Rock"" owing to its likeness to the Bass Rock in Scotland.  The name Bass Rock has also appeared on charts as an alternative name for an island in the Joinville Island group.  To avoid confusion of these names, in 1954 the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended an entirely new name for the rock at Fitchie Bay.  Baldred Rock is named after Saint Baldred, the first hermit known to have lived on the Scottish Bass Rock. Black Rock Harbor Light: Black Rock Harbor Light, also known as Fayerweather Island Light, is a lighthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States which stands on the south end of Fayerweather Island and marks the entrance to Black Rock Harbor.  The first lighthouse at the site, built by Abisha Woodward under contract with the United States government, was a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by 1808.  A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823.  The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore.  The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934.  Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000.  Black Rock Lighthouse is listed as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district. Bass Rock Lighthouse: The Bass Rock Lighthouse on Bass Rock is a 20 m lighthouse, built in 1902 by David Stevenson, who demolished the 13th-century keep, or governor's house, and some other buildings within the castle for the stone.  The commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board decided that a lighthouse should be erected on the Bass Rock in July 1897 along with another light at Barns Ness near Dunbar.  The cost of constructing the Bass Rock light was £8,087, a light first being shone from the rock on the evening of 1 November 1902.  It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board’s headquarters in Edinburgh.  Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle.  Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used. Split Rock Lighthouse: Split Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located southwest of Silver Bay, Minnesota, USA on the North Shore of Lake Superior.  The structure was designed by lighthouse engineer Ralph Russell Tinkham and was completed in 1910 by the United States Lighthouse Service at a cost of $75,000, including the buildings and the land.  It is considered one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States. New Brighton Lighthouse: New Brighton Lighthouse or Perch Rock Lighthouse, is a decommissioned lighthouse situated at the confluence of the River Mersey and Liverpool Bay on an outcrop off New Brighton known locally as Perch Rock.  Together with its neighbour, the Napoleonic era Fort Perch Rock, it is one of the Wirral's best known landmarks. Bass Rock: The Bass Rock, or simply the Bass ( ), is an island in the outer part of the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland.  Approximately 2 km offshore, and 5 km north-east of North Berwick, it is a steep-sided volcanic rock, 107 m at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets.  The rock is uninhabited, but historically has been settled by an early Christian hermit, and later was the site of an important castle, which after the Commonwealth period was used as a prison.  The island belongs to Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, whose family acquired it in 1706, and before to the Lauder family for almost six centuries.  The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of an ancient chapel survive. Halfway Rock Light: Halfway Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on a barren ledge in Casco Bay, Maine.  The lighthouse tower, which has a height of 76 ft , and the attached ex-boathouse are all that remain, as the other buildings have been taken away in storms.  The name ""Halfway Rock"" comes from the position of the rock which is halfway between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small, the southwest and northeast extremities of Casco Bay, which are about 18 nmi apart. Ida Lewis Rock Light: Ida Lewis Lighthouse, which was formerly the Lime Rock Lighthouse, is in the Newport harbor in Rhode Island.  It is named after Ida Lewis, who lived and worked at the lighthouse from 1857 and was the official lighthouse keeper from 1879 until her death in 1911.  She was celebrated for many acts of bravery in saving lives. Canty Bay: Canty Bay is a coastal hamlet off the A198, in East Lothian, Scotland, situated opposite the Bass Rock and Tantallon Castle.  Settlements nearby include Auldhame, Scoughall, Seacliff, and the Peffer Sands.

Upon reviewing the context provided, it appears that Kniphofia and Baptisia both have herbaceous vegetation in common. They are described as herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers.","Dinaric calcareous block fir forest: The Dinaric calcareous silver fir forests are an endemic vegetation type of the littoral Dinaric Alps, located in southeastern Europe.  Pure stands of Dinaric calcareous Silver fir —""Abies alba"" forests appear on limestone escarpments in the montane zones of Orjen, Velebit, Biokovo and Prenj.  They comprise one of the most interesting formations of Balkan vegetation types as the forests bear several rare plants and are of striking beauty.  As a highly endemic and rare vegetation type of the Dinarids it needs protection. Kniphofia: Kniphofia , also called tritoma, red hot poker, torch lily, knofflers or poker plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae, first described as a genus in 1794.  It is native to Africa.  Herbaceous species and hybrids have narrow, grass-like leaves 10 - long, while perennial species have broader, strap-shaped foliage up to 1.5 m long.  All plants produce spikes of upright, brightly coloured flowers well above the foliage, in shades of red, orange and yellow, often bicoloured.  The flowers produce copious nectar while blooming and are attractive to bees.  In the New World they may attract sap-suckers such as hummingbirds and New World orioles. Caatinga: Caatinga (] ) is a type of desert vegetation, which can also be called Jola Jolilo (Jou-lah-Jouh-Liloy).  It is the indian name for the Caatinga, and an ecoregion characterized by this vegetation in interior northeastern Brazil.  The name ""Caatinga"" is a Tupi word meaning ""white forest"" or ""white vegetation"" (""caa"" = forest, vegetation, ""tinga"" = white). Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos: Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos is a critically endangered vegetation type that is endemic to Cape Town.  Though closest to Fynbos, it has characteristics of both Fynbos and Renosterveld vegetation and is thus actually a unique hybrid vegetation type. Desert dry wash: Desert dry wash is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the flat bottoms of canyons and drainages that lack water at or near the surface most of the year, and are subject to periodic severe flooding events.  Desert dry wash is contrasted with desert riparian vegetation, which occurs in desert canyons and drainages where there is year-round water at or near the surface.  Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event.  Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event.  They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding.  Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (""Psorothamnus spinosus""), desert willow (""Chilopsis linearis""), catclaw (""Senegalia greggii""), cheesebush (""Ambrosia salsola""), and waterweed (""Baccharis sergiloides""). Baptisia: Baptisia (wild indigo, false indigo) is a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae.  They are flowering herbaceous perennial plants with pea-like flowers, followed by pods, which are sometimes inflated.  They are native to woodland and grassland in eastern and southern North America.  The species most commonly found in cultivation is ""B. australis"". Desert riparian: Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (""Populus fremontii""), Arizona ash (""Fraxinus velutina""), arroyo willow (""Salix lasiolepis""), Goodding's willow (""Salix gooddingii""), red willow (""Salix laevigata""), California fan palm (""Washingtonia filifera""), and invasive species such as salt cedar (""Tamarix ramosissima""), giant reed (""Arundo donax""), and Russian olive (""Elaeagnus angustifolia"").  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees. Vegetation and slope stability: Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots. Vegetation classification: Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. Wildfire: A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.  Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.

"The largest ship in the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners had how many gross register tons?","The largest ship in the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners had 50,000 gross register tons.","The largest ship in the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners had 56,551 gross register tons.","Over 50,000 gross register tons.","Apologies for any confusion caused. Based on the provided context, the largest ship in the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners had a gross register tonnage of over 50,000 tons.","The previous response was incorrect. The largest ship in the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners, the ""Bismarck"" (1914), had a gross register tonnage of 56,551.","Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous response. Based on the context provided, the ""Imperator"" class ocean liners were over 50,000 gross register tons.","Net register tonnage: Net register tonnage (NRT, nrt, n.r.t.) is a ship's cargo volume capacity expressed in ""register tons"", one of which equals to a volume of 100 cuft .  It is calculated by subtracting non-revenue-earning spaces i.e. spaces not available for carrying cargo, for example engine rooms, fuel tanks and crew quarters, from the ship's gross register tonnage.  Net register tonnage is not a measure of the weight of the ship or its cargo, and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement. Olympic-class ocean liner: The ""Olympic""-class ocean liners were a trio of British ocean liners built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard for the White Star Line during the early 20th century.  They were ""Olympic"" (1911), ""Titanic"" (1912), and ""Britannic"" (1915).  All three were designed to be the largest and most luxurious passenger ships in the world, designed to give White Star an advantage in the transatlantic passenger trade.  Two were lost early in their careers: ""Titanic"" sank in 1912 on its maiden voyage, after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean, and ""Britannic"" in 1916, after hitting a mine laid by the minelayer submarine ""U-73"" in a barrier off Kea in the Aegean Sea during World War I.  ""Olympic"", the lead vessel, had a career spanning 24 years and was retired in 1934 and sold for scrapping in 1935. Nimrod (ship): Nimrod was the ship Ernest Shackleton used in his 1908 Antarctic Nimrod Expedition for the South Pole.  It was a 41-year-old schooner of 334 gross register tons that had been used to hunt seals and whales.  Shackleton, who paid £5,000 for the ship, had it re-rigged as a barquentine.  It also had an auxiliary steam engine, but had a top speed of only six knots under this power.  In addition, the ship was so overloaded with supplies for the expedition that it could not carry enough coal to make passage to the Antarctic from New Zealand, and Shackleton had to arrange for the ship to be towed to the edge of the pack ice by tramp steamer ""Koonya"".  The New Zealand government paid half the cost of the tow; Sir James Mills, Chairman of the Union Steamship Company, paid the other half.  The ""Koonya"" was captained by Fredrick Pryce Evans during the tow. Athenic-class ocean liner: The ""Athenic""-class ocean liners were a three ship class of ocean liners built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard for the White Star Line in the early 20th century. Gross register tonnage: Gross register tonnage (GRT, grt, g.r.t. ""gt"") a ship's total internal volume expressed in ""register tons"", each of which is equal to 100 cuft .  Gross register tonnage uses the total permanently enclosed capacity of the vessel as its basis for volume. Imperator-class ocean liner: The ""Imperator"" class ocean liners were a series of three ocean liners designed for the Hamburg America Line, commonly known as ""HAPAG"".  These three ships were commissioned by the chairman of HAPAG Albert Ballin.  Namely the ""Imperator"" (1912), the ""Vaterland"" (1913) and the largest, the ""Bismarck"" (1914).  These liners were over 50,000 tons, sported three funnels and had a length ranging from 906 ft (276 m) to 955.8 ft (291.3 m).  To this day, the ""Vaterland"" is the largest passenger ship operated by a German shipping company. RMS Majestic (1914): RMS ""Majestic was a White Star ocean liner working on the North Atlantic run, originally launched in 1914 as the Hamburg America Line liner SS ""Bismarck.  At 56,551 gross register tons, she was the largest ship in the world until completion of  in 1935. Titanic II: Titanic II is a planned ocean liner, to be built as a modern-day replica of the ""Olympic""-class  .  The new ship will have a gross tonnage (GT) of 56,000 while the original ship measured about 46,000 gross register tons (GRT).  The project was announced by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer in April 2012, as the flagship of a proposed cruise company Blue Star Line Pty. Ltd. of Brisbane, Australia.  The intended launch date was originally set in 2016, with the ship sailing from Southampton to New York within the same year.  However, construction of the ship has been delayed to 2018.  , construction is yet to commence. Barbarossa-class ocean liner: The ""Barbarossa"" class was a class of ocean liners of North German Lloyd and the Hamburg America Line of the German Empire.  Of the ten ships built between 1896 and 1902, six were built by AG Vulcan Stettin, three were built by Blohm & Voss, and one was built by Schichau-Werke; all were built in Germany.  They averaged  gross register tons (GRT) and featured twin screw propellers driven by quadruple-expansion steam engines. MS Princess of Tasmania: MS Princess of Tasmania was an Australian-built roll-on/roll-off passenger ship.  She was built by the State Dockyard in Newcastle, New South Wales for the Australian National Line.  Laid down on 15 November 1957, she was launched on 15 December 1958.  As built, the ship had a tonnage value of  gross register tons (GRT) , was 113.32 m long, had a beam of 17.73 m , and a draught of 4.74 m .

Based on the given context, the republic with the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe is San Marino.

The type species is ""S. syrticus"" of late Miocene Africa, which reached roughly 4 m (13.1 ft) in shoulder height.  The other unequivocally recognized species is ""S. orbus"", also of late Miocene Africa.  Other species outside of Africa are questionably placed in this genus, including teeth from Late Miocene Hungary and Iran originally described as being of the ""Mastodon"" subgenus ""Bunolophodon"", Chinese specimens originally described as being also of ""Mastodon"", as well as of ""Tetralophodon"" and ""Stegodon"", and a species from the late Miocene-aged Dokh Pathan Formation in Pakistan, ""S. maluvalensis"". Volvopluteus michiganensis: Volvopluteus michiganensis is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae.  It was originally described under the name ""Pluteus michiganensis"" but molecular studies have placed it in the ""Volvopluteus"", a genus described in 2011.  The cap of this mushroom is about 7 – in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh.  The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink.  The stipe is white and has a volva at the base.  Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species.  ""V. michiganensis"" is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on sawdust.  It has only been reported from Michigan (USA) and the Dominican Republic. Jurodidae: The beetle family Jurodidae was originally described from fossils, but in 1996, a single species from the Russian Far East, described as Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae, was found and later was recognized to be a living representative of this otherwise extinct family (a ""living fossil"").  Since then, this beetle, known from only a single specimen, has been the source of contention, as it is reported to possess three ocelli on its forehead, a condition otherwise unknown in the entire order Coleoptera, whether extinct or living - though it is common in other orders, and generally considered a groundplan character for neopteran insects.  If true, this species may represent the most archaic of all living beetles.  However, other authorities have challenged this interpretation, and have further suggested that this beetle does not even belong to the Archostemata.  This may not be possible to resolve until additional specimens are collected, allowing for genetic analysis. Agonum fuliginosum: Agonum fuliginosum is a species of ground beetle in the Platyninae family.  It was described by Panzer in 1809 and can be found everywhere in Europe except for Albania, Andorra, Monaco, Portugal, San Marino, Vatican City and various European islands. Selatosomus aeneus: Selatosomus aeneus is a species of click beetle found in Europe.  It was originally described as ""Corymbites aeneus"" by Carl Linnaeus. Protostropharia alcis: Protostropharia alcis is a species of coprophilous agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae.  It was originally described by Finnish mycologist Ilkka Kytövuori in 1999, as one of six species in the """"Stropharia semiglobata"""" group in northwestern Europe.  The fungus produces fruit bodies on moose [known in Europe as European elk] dung.  In 2013, the fungus named after ""Alces alces"" was transferred by Redhead et al. to ""Protostropharia"", a genus circumscribed to contain ""Stropharia"" species characterized by the formation of astrocystidia rather than acanthocytes on their mycelium.  In addition to Europe, the species has also been recorded in Brazil.  The variety ""austrobrasiliensis"" was described from Rio Grande do Sul in 2008, where it grows on cow dung, or dung-enriched soil. Cicindela albissima: Cicindela albissima, commonly called the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle is a species of tiger beetle endemic to Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in southern Utah, United States.  It was originally described by Rumpp in 1962 as the subspecies ""Cicindela limbata albissima"", but mitochondrial DNA, along with the species' morphological and geographical distinctiveness, have shown that it is a separate species.  ""C. albissima"" can be distinguished from other ""Cicindela"" species by its restricted range and lack of pigmentation on its elytra. Bark beetle: A bark beetle is one of about 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the subfamily Scolytinae.  Traditionally, this was considered a distinct family Scolytidae, but is now understood to be very specialized members of the ""true weevil"" family (Curculionidae).  Well-known species are members of the type genus ""Scolytus"", namely the European elm bark beetle ""S. multistriatus"" and the large elm bark beetle ""S. scolytus"", which like the American elm bark beetle ""Hylurgopinus rufipes"", transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (""Ophiostoma"").  The mountain pine beetle ""Dendroctonus ponderosae"", southern pine beetle ""Dendroctonus frontalis"", and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America.  A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips ""Ips typographus"".  A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, ""Hypothenemus hampei"" is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world. Scydosella: Scydosella is a genus of beetles that consists of only one species Scydosella musawasensis.  The species is regarded as the smallest free-living insect, as well as the smallest beetle.  They are among featherwing beetle, named because of their feather-like spiny wings.  It was first discovered in Nicaragua, and described in 1999 by Wesley Eugene Hall of the University of Nebraska State Museum.  The initial discovery consisted of very few specimens, and exact measurements were not conclusive.  Because of their tiny size, they were difficult to observe under microscope after preservation.  The generally accepted size was 0.300 mm in length.  On 8 February 2015, Alexey Polilov of the Lomonosov Moscow State University collected 85 specimens in Chicaque National Park, Colombia.  They were discovered on a layer of fungus on which they feed.  From these specimens exact measurements could be made, and was found that the smallest individual is only 0.325 mm long.  The largest individual is 0.352 mm long, and the average length of all the specimens is 0.338 mm.  The body is elongated and oval in shape, yellowish-brown in colour, and its antennae are split into 10 segments. San Marino: San Marino ( ; ] ), officially the Republic of San Marino (Italian: ""Repubblica di San Marino"" ), also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino (Italian: ""Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino"" ), is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains.  Its size is just over 61 sqkm , with a population of 33,562.  Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest city is Serravalle.  San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe.

Temple of the Dog (album): Temple of the Dog is the only studio album by the American rock band Temple of the Dog, released on April 16, 1991, through A&M Records.  The album is a tribute to Andrew Wood, the former lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone, who died on March 19, 1990, of a heroin overdose.  The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States. Port of Morrow (album): Port of Morrow is the fourth studio album by American rock band The Shins.  The album was released March 19, 2012, on Aural Apothecary and Columbia Records and was co-produced by Greg Kurstin and frontman James Mercer.

Mercer deemed it an ""aesthetic decision"" to part ways with his bandmates, and in the interim, founded side project Broken Bells with Danger Mouse. High Road (album): High Road is an album by Canadian folk rock band The Grapes of Wrath, released March 19, 2013 on Aporia Records.

Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics: Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics is the debut studio album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend, originally released as Cooked on Phonics under the fictional band name Punky Brüster.  It was released on Townsend's label, HevyDevy Records, on March 19, 1996.  It is a metal/punk rock parody concept album written by Townsend.  ""Cooked on Phonics"" tells the story of a fictitious death metal band ""from South Central Poland"" called Cryptic Coroner that sells out their metal look and sound to become a commercial punk rock band called Punky Brüster (the band's name is a pun on the 80's U.S. television series ""Punky Brewster""). Specter at the Feast: Specter at the Feast is the seventh studio album by American rock band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, released on March 18, 2013 in Europe and March 19, 2013 in the US.  It was released under the band's own record label, Abstract Dragon, through Vagrant Records.  Unlike ""Beat The Devil's Tattoo"", the album wasn't produced by Michael Been, who died after he suffered a heart attack mid-tour in 2010 while the band was playing at Pukkelpop.  As a result, ""Specter at the Feast"" was a way for the band to mourn their loss and rid the pain, as he was the father of bassist Robert Levon Been, but also their live sound technician and a mentor to all the members.

The First Silesian War was actually fought between Prussia, under King Frederick the Great, and Austria. The war took place between 1740 and 1742. King Frederick the Great, who was the ruler of Prussia during this time, did not die during the First Silesian War. He reigned as the King of Prussia from 1740 until his death in 1786.","I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The First Silesian War was not fought against the King of Prussia. The First Silesian War was fought between Prussia, under King Frederick the Great, and Austria, under Empress Maria Theresa, from 1740 to 1742. The King of Prussia, Frederick the Great, did not die during the First Silesian War. He reigned as King of Prussia from 1740 until 1786.","Apologies for the incorrect response. The First Silesian War was fought between Prussia and Austria between 1740 and 1742. However, there is no mention of the death of the King of Prussia in the given context.","Second Silesian War: The Second Silesian War was a theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria between 1744 and 1745, fought mainly in Silesia, Bohemia, and Upper Saxony.  It was the second in a series of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria. First Silesian War: The First Silesian War was a theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria between 1740 and 1742, fought mainly in Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia (the lands of the Bohemian Crown).  It became the first in a series of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria. Battle of Mollwitz: The Battle of Mollwitz was fought by Prussia and Austria on 10 April 1741, during the First Silesian War (in the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession).  It was the first battle of the new Prussian King Frederick II, in which both sides made numerous military blunders but Frederick the Great still managed to attain victory.  This battle cemented his authority over the newly conquered territory of Silesia and gave him valuable military experience. Battle of Chotusitz: The Battle of Chotusitz, or Chotusice, sometimes called the Battle of Czaslau, was fought on May 17, 1742, in Bohemia between the Austrians under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and the Prussians under Frederick the Great.  The battle was a part of the War of the Austrian Succession, sometimes referred to as the First Silesian War.  The armies were about equal at 28,000 to 30,000 each, with the Prussians having about 2,000 more infantry and the Austrians some 2,000 more cavalry.  The Austrians were attempting to retake occupied Prague and the Prussians were trying to block them from accomplishing that.  The battle of Chotusitz was especially notable in that it was the only major battle started by the Austrians during this war. Treaty of Breslau: The Treaty of Breslau was a preliminary peace agreement signed on 11 June 1742 following long negotiations at the Silesian capital Wrocław (German: ""Breslau"" ) by emissaries of Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria and King Frederick II of Prussia ending the First Silesian War. Treaty of Berlin (1742): The Treaty of Berlin between the Habsburg archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, who was also Queen of Bohemia, and the Prussian king Frederick the Great was signed on 28 July 1742 in Berlin.  It was the formal peace treaty that confirmed the preliminary agreement achieved with English mediation by the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, and officially ended the First Silesian War. Silesian Wars: The Silesian Wars (German: ""Schlesische Kriege"" ) were a series of three wars fought in the mid-18th century between Prussia (under King Frederick the Great) and Austria (under Empress Maria Theresa) for control of Silesia, all three of which ended in Prussian victory.  The First (1740–42) and Second (1744–45) Silesian Wars formed a part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession, while the Third Silesian War (1756–63) was one theater of the Seven Years' War. Frederick the Great: Frederick II (German: ""Friedrich"" ; 24 January 171217 August 1786) was King of Prussia from 1740 until 1786, the longest reign of any Hohenzollern king.  His most significant accomplishments during his reign included his military victories, his reorganization of Prussian armies, his patronage of the arts and the Enlightenment in Prussia, and his final success against great odds in the Seven Years' War.  Frederick was the last titled King in Prussia and declared himself King of Prussia after achieving full sovereignty for all historical Prussian lands.  Prussia had greatly increased its territories and became a leading military power in Europe under his rule.  He became known as Frederick the Great (""Friedrich der Große "") and was affectionately nicknamed ""Der Alte Fritz "" (""Old Fritz"") by the Prussian and later by all German people. Third Silesian War: The Third Silesian War was a theatre of the Seven Years' War.  The name is used to describe Prussia's war against Austria and its allies between 1756 and 1763, fought mainly in Silesia, Bohemia and Upper Saxony.  The war was the third and last in a series of Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria; like the earlier two, it ended with Prussia in control of the region of Silesia. Treaty of Hubertusburg: The Treaty of Hubertusburg (German: ""Frieden von Hubertusburg"" ) was signed on 15 February 1763 at Hubertusburg Castle by Prussia, Austria and Saxony to end the Third Silesian War.  Together with the Treaty of Paris, signed five days earlier, it marked the end of the Seven Years' War.  The treaty ended the continental conflict with no significant changes in prewar borders.  Austria and Saxony renounced all claims to the Silesian territories ceded to Prussia in the 1742 Treaty of Berlin and the 1745 Treaty of Dresden.  Prussia clearly stood among the ranks of the European great powers, while the treaty enhanced the rivalry with Austria.

Edatata Narayanan: Edatata Narayanan (1907–1978) was a famous journalist and a freedom fighter from India.  He took active part in the freedom struggle through the Congress Socialist Party, a caucus within the Congress Party for activists with socialist leanings.  He was among those who were disillusioned with the progress of Congress party on socialism and formed a new party, Socialist Party in 1948.  He however left that party along with Aruna Asaf Ali and they visited Moscow along with Rajani Palme Dutt.  Both of them joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) before Joseph Stalin's death but left the party in 1956 following Nikita Khrushchev's disowning of Stalin.  Edatata Narayanan started a daily newspaper, ""Patriot""(1963)° as the Chief Editor and was also associated with a weekly, ""Link"" in 1958 along with Aruna Asaf Ali.  The publications became prestigious due to patronage of leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon and Biju Patnaik.  When Edatata Narayanan wanted to make some editorial changes amidst reported opposition from the editorial staff, he told them in no uncertain terms that he belonged to the school of journalism where the editor's view is final.  He brought ""Patriot"" into the spotlight by publishing the income tax returns of top industrialists in it and thus, bringing the information into public domain.  He pursued a pro-CPI and pro-Left editorial policy - Indira Gandhi, a good friend and later the Prime Minister of India herself was pro-left.  The publications and the associated publishing house were successful.  The relationship between him and Aruna Asaf Ali was controversial as they were believed to be living together, despite no formal marriage.  He wrote a book titled ""Praja Socialism: Monopoly's Pawn"" on the merger of the Socialist Party with the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (founded by Acharya Kripalani). Mian Kifait Ali: Major Mian Kifait Ali (July 1902 – 1 December 1994) was a pioneer of the Pakistan movement, his masterpiece book """"Confederacy of India"""" published in 1939, under the pen name ""A Punjabi"" was the first to deal with political, economic and administrative aspects of Pakistan.  He was amongst the first to respond to the call of Pakistan sounded by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 (Qutote from Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Prime Minister of Pakistan), Dr. Khursheed kamal aziz Pakistan's official historian) has described this book as ""the most comprehensive and far reaching scheme aimed at furthering and elaborating the idea of Pakistan.  Waheed uz-Zaman wrote in his book, ""Pakistan"", Lahore, 1964, P. 168, ""The book was taken into consideration by the Muslim league, while preparing the Lahore resolution and the fact the solution proposed in the confederacy of India"" differed but little from the proposed by the Muslim League in March 1940.  The venear of a Confederacy, which was the main theme of his scheme, could anytime be set aside and the remainder would have precisely... Pakistan.  So scholarly and so cogent was his reasoning that men like Dr.Rajendra Prasad felt compelled to join issues with him in his books, (""Pakistan""(Bombay and Calcutta, September 1940), p 34; see also his book """"India Divided"""" page 180-181).  The book was reviewed in leading newspapers and journals.  Comparatively more scholarly appraisal was in the ""Tarjaman-ul-Quran"" of Maulana Abul Ala Maududi.  According to Mian Kifait Ali ""The idea was suggested to me by the late Choudhary Rahmat Ali's writings and I developmed it to an extent to which no one had done earlier (Letter to Dr. K.K, September 5, 1968)"".  Ali also stated that originally it was proposed to publish the book under the title of ""Pakistan"" a typed manuscript which bore this page title was sent to the press.  Soon after he received a telegraphic message from the Muhammad Ali Jinnah that book should not appear under the pen name of ""Pakistan"".  It was to comply with the Quaid's directive he prepared a federal scheme and was incorporated in the introduction of the book.  Thus the book was titled as ""Confederacy of India"".  (Nation article, 23 December 1994 by Sarfraz Hussain Mirza, """"Confederacy of India by A Punjabi"""", also in Daily Times, Cam Diary, """"Pak history in Leichester"""", and article by V.P Bhatia """"'Jinnah was against the name 'Pakistan' at First"""".  It was in recognition of this work of Mian Kifait Ali that he was invited to work on the committee presided over by Sir Abdullah Haroon set up in February 1940 to examine the various schemes of constitutional reforms for India and to see whether a consolidated scheme can finally be framed.  His book has been referred to as the most comprehensive schemes at demystifying and detailing the ideas regarding the inception of Pakistan, quite a lot has been written about him and his work.  Mian Kifait Ali has done ""pioneering work in the evolution of Muslim political thoughts and has suffered the hardship of a pioneer… when an objective appraisal of Muslim political movement is made by the historian.  He will find an honourable place among the pioneers and selfless workers in this great field of Muslim reconstruction (Quoted by Governor Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani).  Famous independence-era personalities such as Abul Ala Maududi, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon, and Sardar V. Patel took issue with him.  He responded in several pamphlets. Laxmi Mall Singhvi: L. M. Singhvi (9 November 1931 – 6 October 2007) was an Indian jurist, parliamentarian, scholar, writer and diplomat.  He was, after V. K. Krishna Menon, the second-longest-serving High Commissioner for India in the United Kingdom (1991–97) He was conferred Padma Bhushan in 1998.

Comparing the locations on a map, it can be determined that AMD's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California is further west than Level 3 Communications' headquarters in Broomfield, Colorado.","Level 3 Communications is headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, which is further west than the headquarters of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in Sunnyvale, California.","Mark Papermaster: Mark Papermaster is the Chief Technology Officer at Advanced Micro Devices.  He had been the Senior Vice President of Devices Hardware Engineering at Apple Inc.  He replaced Tony Fadell who was responsible for the team that created the iPod.  Papermaster worked at IBM from 1982 to 2008.  His last position at IBM was as vice president of IBM's blade server division.  In 2008, Papermaster's decision to move from IBM to Apple became central to a court case considering the validity and scope of an employee non-compete clause in the technology industry.  In August 2010 he stepped down from his position because of issues with Apple's internal politics and corporate culture. Software Spectrum: Software Spectrum is a company acquired by Level 3 Communications in 2002.  Insight Enterprises purchased Software Spectrum from Level 3 Communications in September 2006.  It is the world's largest Microsoft Large Account Reseller (LAR).  In addition, the company sells a full array of software for PCs and servers, including Adobe, Symantec and Trend Micro. GlobalFoundries: GlobalFoundries (stylized as GLOBALFOUNDRIES) is a semiconductor foundry headquartered in Santa Clara, California, United States.  GlobalFoundries was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on March 2, 2009, expanded through the acquisition of Chartered Semiconductor on January 23, 2010, and further expanded through the acquisition of IBM Microelectronics on July 1, 2015.  The Emirate of Abu Dhabi is the owner of the company through its subsidiary Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC).  On March 4, 2012, AMD announced they divested their final 14% stake in the company, which concluded AMD's multi-year plan to divest its manufacturing arm. Hector Ruiz: Hector de Jesus Ruiz Cardenas (born December 25, 1945) is the chairman and CEO of Advanced Nanotechnology Solutions, Inc. and former CEO & executive chairman of semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). Advanced Micro Devices: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Sunnyvale, California, United States, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.  While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009.  AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers, workstations and personal computers, and embedded systems applications. Torrenza: Torrenza was an initiative announced by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in 2006 to improve support for the integration of specialized coprocessors in systems based on AMD Opteron microprocessors.  Torrenza does not refer to a specific product or specific technology, though the primary focus is on the integration of coprocessor devices directly connected to the Opteron processors' HyperTransport links, and other co-processors connected via PCI Express.  The initiative's stated goals include improving technical and technology support for third-party developers of coprocessing devices, reducing the cost of implementing HyperTransport interfaces on these devices, and improving the performance of the integrated system.  It can be argued, that the original idea behind Torrenza was successfully implemented in form of Heterogeneous System Architecture by AMD and the other members of the HSA Foundation. Framewave: Framewave (formerly AMD Performance Library (APL)) is computer software, a high-performance optimized programming library, consisting of low level application programming interfaces (APIs) for image processing, signal processing, JPEG, and video functions.  These APIs are programmed with task level parallelization (multi-threading) and instruction-level parallelism single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) for maximum performance on multi-core processors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Miniature Card: Miniature Card or MiniCard was a flash or SRAM memory card standard first promoted by Intel in 1995.  The card was backed by Advanced Micro Devices, Fujitsu and Sharp Electronics.  They are no longer manufactured.  The Miniature Card Implementers Forum (MCIF) promoted this standard for consumer electronics, such as PDAs and palmtops, digital audio recorders, digital cameras and early smartphones.  The Miniature Card is 37 × 45 × 3.5 mm thick and can have devices on both sides of the substrate.  Its 60-pin connector was a memory-only subset of PCMCIA and featured 16-bit data and 24-bit address bus with 3.3 or 5-volt signaling.  Miniature Cards support Attribute Information Structure (AIS) in the I²C identification EEPROM. AMD Am2900: Am2900 is a family of integrated circuits (ICs) created in 1975 by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).  They were constructed with bipolar devices, in a bit-slice topology, and were designed to be used as modular components each representing a different aspect of a computer control unit (CCU).  By using a bit slicing technique, Am2900 family was able to implement a CCU with data, addresses, and instructions to be any multiple of 4 bits by multiplying the number of ICs.  One major problem with this modular technique was it required a larger amount of ICs to implement what could be done on a single CPU IC.  The Am2901 chip was the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU), and the ""core"" of the series.  It could count using 4 bits and implement binary operations as well as various bit-shifting operations. Level 3 Communications: Level 3 Communications is an American multinational telecommunications and Internet service provider company headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado.

The novel was first released in Spanish in 2011.  Larry Rohter in his review of the English translation in ""the New York Times"" said ""The novel offers readers plot lines and characters that supplement or propose variations on Mr. Bolaño’s 900-page magnum opus, ""2666"""".  An English-language translation by Natasha Wimmer was published in the US on November 13, 2012, by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.  An editorial note appended to the book by Bolaño’s widow describes it as “a project that was begun in the 1980s and continued to be a work in progress up until the year 2003 [...] this edition was undertaken with the unwavering intent to respect Bolaño’s work and the firm pledge to offer the reader the novel as it had been found in his files.” The Savage Detectives: The Savage Detectives (""Los Detectives Salvajes"" in Spanish) is a novel by the Chilean author Roberto Bolaño in 1998.  Natasha Wimmer's English translation was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2007.

His works include the novels ""Confessions of a Mask"" and ""The Temple of the Golden Pavilion"", and the autobiographical essay ""Sun and Steel"".  His avant-garde work displayed a blending of modern and traditional aesthetics that broke cultural boundaries, with a focus on sexuality, death, and political change.  Mishima was active as a nationalist and founded his own right-wing militia, the Tatenokai.  In 1970, he and three other members of his militia staged an attempted ""coup d'état"" when they seized control of a Japanese military base and took the commander hostage, then tried and failed to inspire a coup to restore the Emperor's pre-war powers.  Mishima then committed ritual suicide by ""seppuku"".  The coup attempt became known as the ""Mishima Incident"".

Thank you for pointing out the error, and I apologize for any confusion caused.","Soma mine disaster: On 13 May 2014, an explosion at a coal mine in Soma, Manisa, Turkey, caused an underground mine fire, which burned until 15 May.  In total, 301 people were killed in what was the worst mine disaster in Turkey's history.  The mine, operated by coal producer Soma Kömür İşletmeleri A.Ş. , suffered an explosion, the cause of which is still under investigation.  The fire occurred at the mine's shift change, and 787 workers were underground at the time of the explosion.  After the final bodies were pulled from the mine on May 17, 2014, four days after the fire, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yıldız confirmed the number of dead was 301.  Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) announced the names of 301 workers who died in the mine disaster and 486 people who survived but some politicians claimed that the number of dead is more than 340. Benwood mine disaster: The Benwood Mine Disaster was a coal mine explosion that occurred on Monday, April 28, 1924, at the Benwood Mine of the former Wheeling Steel Corporation steel mill located in the city of Benwood in Marshall County, West Virginia.  The explosion claimed the lives of 119 coal miners.  There were no survivors.  It is the third worst coal mining disaster in the state of West Virginia after the Monongah Mine disaster of December 6, 1907 that claimed the lives of 361 miners and the Eccles Mine Disaster of April 28, 1914 that claimed the lives of 183 miners. Ferris-Haggarty Mine Site: The Ferris-Haggerty Mine Site was one of the richest components of the Grand Encampment Mining District in Carbon County, Wyoming.  The site was first exploited by Ed Haggerty, a prospector from Whitehaven, England, in 1897 when he established the Rudefeha Mine on a rich deposit of copper ore.  Haggerty was backed by George Ferris and other investors, of whom all but Ferris dropped out.  The partners sold an interest to Willis George Emerson, who raised investment funding for improvements to the mine.  These facilities included a 16 mi aerial tramway from Grand Encampment over the Continental Divide to the in Encampment.  The mine's assets were eventually acquired by the North American Copper Company for $1 million.  By 1904 the mine had produced $1.4 million in copper ore, and was sold to the Penn-Wyoming Copper Company.  However, even with copper prices peaking in 1907, the company had difficulty making a profit from the remote mine site.  The company was over-capitalized and under-insured and was suffered devastating fires at the mine site in March 1906 and May 1907 which halted production.  Business disputes and a fall in copper prices prevented re-opening of the mine even after it was rebuilt.  Machinery was salvaged after a foreclosure in 1913.  A total of $2 million in copper ore was extracted from the mine during its life. Barton Mine: Barton Mine, also known as Net Lake Mine, is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It is located about 0.50 km north of the Temagami Arena in Temagami North and just east of the Ontario Northland Railway in northwestern Strathy Township.  Dating back to the early 1900s, it is one of the oldest mines in Temagami.  Barton was the site of a fire in the early 1900s, after which it never had active mining again. Intersos: INTERSOS is a non-profit humanitarian aid organization that works to assist victims of natural disaster and armed conflict.  INTERSOS has operated as an independent organization since its foundation in 1992, its humanitarian actions are based on values of solidarity, justice, human dignity, respect for diversity, and equal rights and opportunities for all people, especially the most vulnerable.  Through its own humanitarian operators, INTERSOS intervenes to answer the needs of people in serious crises situations, mainly in the world's poorest regions, who are suffering, deprived of rights, dignity and essentials goods.  A Mine Action Unit was established within INTERSOS to deal specifically with the mine danger and its effects through mine awareness, victims assistance and mine clearance operations. Sago Mine disaster: The Sago Mine disaster was a coal mine explosion on January 2, 2006, at the Sago Mine in Sago, West Virginia, United States, near the Upshur County seat of Buckhannon.  The blast and collapse trapped 13 miners for nearly two days; only one survived.  It was the worst mining disaster in the United States since the Jim Walter Resources Mine disaster in Alabama on September 23, 2001, and the worst disaster in West Virginia since the 1968 Farmington Mine disaster.  It was exceeded four years later by the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, also a coal mine explosion in West Virginia, which killed 29 miners in April 2010. List of natural disasters by death toll: A natural disaster is a sudden event that causes widespread destruction, lots of collateral damage or loss of life, brought about by forces other than the acts of human beings.  A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslide, hurricanes etc.  In order to be classified as a disaster, it will have profound environmental effect and/or human loss and frequently incurs financial loss. Natural disaster: A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes.  A natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage, and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience, or ability to recover and also on the infrastructure available. Camlaren Mine: The Camlaren Mine was a small gold mine 80 km north-east of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada at Gordon Lake.  It consists of a property totaling about 981 hectares.  The two claims that make up the property were staked in 1936 by prospectors Don Cameron and the Mclaren brothers and developed with two shafts during 1937-1938.  The name ""Camlaren"" is a portmanteau of Cameron and McLaren.  Conditions attributed to World War II halted development at Camlaren in 1939. Volcano Disaster Assistance Program: The ‘’’Volcano Disaster Assistance Program’’’ (VDAP) was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance after the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz (Colombia) in 1985.  The volcanic eruption melted a glacier triggering a lahar that killed 23,000 people.  It was determined that increased monitoring and enhanced communications between scientists and civil authorities would make evacuating local populations much easier, saving lives.  Today the program responds to volcanic crises around the world.  The aim of the program is to assist in saving lives and property, to reduce economic losses, and to prevent a natural hazard becoming a natural disaster.  VDAP staff members are based at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory, in Vancouver, Washington.  VDAP channels its energy into four main activities; response to natural disaster, capacity building, training and volcanological research.

""The X-Files"" earned high viewership ratings, and led to Carter's being able to negotiate the creation of future series. Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890: Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890, in Brussels is an important testament to the recognition he received amongst avant-garde peers during his own lifetime.  Participation in the annual exhibition of Les XX was for members and by invitation only.  Van Gogh's choice proves that he was going for more than a simple selection of paintings he considered superior, but that he was willing to provide a well reasoned summary of his years of work in Provence.  Evidently this notion remained neglected, and even more: it was washed away by the scandal his works provoked.  Then the same works were again shown at the annual exhibition of the Artistes Indépendants in Paris which offered space for an expansion of the display: this was done by Theo van Gogh, the brother of Vincent, who was suffering from long lasting mental problems. Theo van Gogh (film director): Theodoor ""Theo"" van Gogh (] ; 23 July 19572 November 2004) was a Dutch film director, film producer, television director, television producer, television presenter, screenwriter, actor, critic and author. Copies by Vincent van Gogh: Copies by Vincent van Gogh form an important group of paintings executed by Vincent van Gogh between 1887 and early 1890.  While at Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, where Van Gogh admitted himself, he strived to have subjects during the cold winter months.  Seeking to be reinvigorated artistically, Van Gogh did more than 30 copies of works by some of his favorite artists.  About twenty-one of the works were copies after, or inspired by, Jean-François Millet.  Rather than replicate, Van Gogh sought to translate the subjects and composition through his perspective, color, and technique.  Spiritual meaning and emotional comfort were expressed through symbolism and color.  His brother Theo van Gogh would call the pieces in the series some of his best work. Murder in Amsterdam: Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance is a 2006 book by Ian Buruma. "" The Guardian"" describes it as, ""part reportage, part essay.""  It explores the impact of mass immigration from Muslim countries on Dutch culture through the lens of the murder of film director and anti-immigration activist, Theo van Gogh.

What professor of mathematics authored the book Fashionable Nonsense?,Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangroom,Alan Sokal,Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangroom,Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. The correct answer to the question is that no professor of mathematics authored the book Fashionable Nonsense. The book was actually authored by Ophelia Benson and Jeremy Stangroom.,"Apologies, but based on the given context, there is no mention of any professor of mathematics authoring the book ""Fashionable Nonsense.""","I apologize for the incorrect response in my previous answer. After reviewing the context again, it is clear that the book ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was authored by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, who are physicists, not professors of mathematics. I apologize for any confusion caused.","Fashionable Nonsense: Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science (French: ""Impostures Intellectuelles"" ), published in the UK as Intellectual Impostures, is a book by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont.  Sokal is best known for the Sokal Affair, in which he submitted a deliberately absurd article to ""Social Text"", a critical theory journal, and was able to get it published. Nairi Sedrakyan: Nairi Sedrakyan (born 1961 in Ninotsminda, USSR) is an Armenian mathematician involved in national and international Olympiads of mathematics, having been the president of Armenian Mathematics Olympiads, the Leader of Armenian IMO Team, jury member and problem selection committee member of International Mathematical Olympiad, jury member and problem selection committee member of Zhautykov International Mathematical Olympiad (ZIMO), jury member and problem selection committee member of the 1st International Olympiad of Metropolises, the president of International Mathematical Olympiad Tournament of the Towns in Armenia.  He has also authored a large number of problems proposed in these Olympiads.  Nairi Sedrakyan is the author of one of the hardest problems ever proposed in the history of International Mathematical Olympiad, 5th problem of 37th International Mathematical Olympiad.  This problem is considered as one of the hardest problems ever, because none of the members of the strongest teams, i.e. National Olympic Teams of the USA, Russia or China has succeeded to solve it correctly.  Moreover, the National Olympic Team of People's Republic of China has obtained a cumulative result equal to 0 points and was ranked the 6th in the final ranking of the countries instead of the usual 1st or 2nd place.  The British 2014 film X+Y, released in the USA as A Brilliant Young Mind, inspired by, Beautiful Young Minds focuses on an English mathematical genius chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the IMO.  In the film this problem is stated to be the hardest problem ever proposed in the history of International Mathematical Olympiad (minutes 9:40-10:30).  Other outstanding results of the author are having 4 problems in the Shortlist of the worldwide selected 27 problems of the 40th IMO (1999) in Romania and having 5 medals winner students in 41st IMO in South Korea, i.e. 2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals.  Moreover, only 1 point was missing for Sevak Mkrtchyan to obtain a Gold Medal (currently he is an assistant professor of mathematics in United States, Sevak received his PhD in mathematics from University of California, Berkley).  Nevertheless, Arthur Barkhoudarian, one of the first students of Nairi Sedrakyan has received a Gold Medal in International Mathematical Olympiad, later on Arthur received his PhD degree in mathematics from Charles University in Prague.  As all winner students were from the same school, where Nairi Sedrakyan was teaching mathematics, the government of the Republic of Armenia gave to the author the title of the best teacher of the Republic of Armenia and he received a special gift from the Prime Minister. Alan Sokal: Alan David Sokal ( ; born January 24, 1955) is a professor of mathematics at University College London and professor of physics at New York University.  He works in statistical mechanics and combinatorics.  He is best known to the wider public for his criticism of postmodernism, after the Sokal affair in 1996 when his deliberately nonsensical paper was published by Duke University's ""Social Text"".  He also works to counter faulty scientific reasoning, as seen with his involvement in criticising the critical positivity ratio concept in positive psychology. Titu Andreescu: Titu Andreescu (born 1956) is an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Texas at Dallas.  He is also firmly involved in mathematics contests and olympiads, having been the Director of AMC (as appointed by the Mathematical Association of America ), Director of MOP, Head Coach of the USA IMO Team and Chairman of the USAMO.  He has also authored a large number of books on the topic of problem solving and olympiad style mathematics. Mark Steiner: Mark Steiner (born May 6, 1942) is a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he specializes in the philosophy of mathematics and physics.  He is best known for his book ""The Applicability of Mathematics as a Philosophical Problem"", in which he attempted to explain the historical utility of mathematics in physics.  The book may be considered an extended meditation on the issues raised by Eugene Wigner's article ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"" .  The publisher writes, ""Steiner argues that, on the contrary, these laws were discovered, using manmade mathematical analogies, resulting in an anthropocentric picture of the universe as ""user friendly"" to human cognition—a challenge to the entrenched dogma of naturalism.""  Steiner is also the author of the book ""Mathematical Knowledge"". Angus Ellis Taylor: Angus Ellis Taylor (October 13, 1911 – April 6, 1999) was a mathematician and professor at various universities in the University of California system.  He earned his undergraduate degree at Harvard ""summa cum laude"" in 1933 and his PhD at Caltech in 1936 under Aristotle Michal with a dissertation on analytic functions. By 1944 he had risen to full professor at UCLA, whose mathematics department he later chaired (1958–1964).  Taylor was also an astute administrator and eventually rose through the UC system to become provost and then chancellor of UC Santa Cruz.  He authored a number of mathematical texts, one of which, ""Advanced Calculus"" (1955, Ginn and Co.), became a standard for a generation of mathematics students. Ruchir Puri: Ruchir Puri is the chief architect of IBM Watson, responsible for developing and deploying Watson platform architecture across the range of Watson offerings.

The station depot was built originally in 1890 to service to new Crocker Wheeler plant in the district.  The station was named in honor of André-Marie Ampère, a pioneer in electrodynamics and reconstructed as a new Renaissance Revival station in 1907 and 1908.  The station was the second station on the branch west of Newark Broad Street Station until 1984, when Roseville Avenue station was closed.  That year, the station, along with 42 others, was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on June 22.  After continuous disrepair and deterioration, New Jersey Transit slowly demolished the old station, including the westbound shelter built in 1922 in 1986 and the station depot itself in 1995.

They formed in 2000 with Tim Evans and Ian Wadley as the core and only continuous members of the group.  The first self-titled recording was performed with Evans on drums, with Wadley and Evans overdubbing the other instruments.  Subsequently, this recording was disowned by the band.  Duncan Haigh joined briefly as a live drummer, but was eventually replaced by Tom Egg as the band's first permanent drummer.  The lineup was filled out by the inclusion of Karl Scullin on bass.  With this lineup, the Bird Blobs recorded an unreleased album in 2002, and then released their debut ""official"" album ""Stihl Life"" in April 2003.  The album was recorded by Simon Grounds (Rocket Science, Venom P. Stinger) at Sublime Sudios in Melbourne.  The rhythm section was subsequently replaced, and the final lineup included Evans, Wadley, bassist Jordan Redaelli and drummer Steve Masterson.  With this lineup they recorded the second self-titled full-length album, which was released in September 2004.  The album was recorded at Woodstock Studios in Melbourne with US engineer Casey Rice (Tortoise, Liz Phair), and later mixed by Simon Grounds.  Both their albums were released through the independent Tasmanian label Unstable Ape.  Their second self-titled album was also released on UK independent label, Sounds of Sweet Nothing. Memory of a Free Festival: ""Memory of a Free Festival"" is a 1970 single by David Bowie.  The song had originally been recorded in September 1969 as a seven-minute opus for Bowie's second self-titled album.  It was reworked in March-April 1970 at the behest of Mercury Records, the label believing that the track had a better chance of success as a single than ""The Prettiest Star"", released earlier in the year.  Bowie and Tony Visconti roughly split the track in half, re-recording it so both halves could function as individual songs.  A more rock-oriented version than the earlier album cut, this rendition marked guitarist Mick Ronson's and drummer Mick Woodmansey's studio debut with Bowie's band, bringing together the line-up that would shortly record ""The Man Who Sold the World"". Radja: Radja is an Indonesian rock band.  The band formed in Jakarta on 17 March 2001, and originally consisted of lead vocalist Ian Kasela, guitarist Moldy Mulyadi, bassist Shuma, and drummer Adit.

The album's singles also fared well, ""Fly from the Inside"" reaching No. 5, ""45"" reaching No. 3, ""Simple Man"" reaching No. 5, and ""Burning Bright"" reaching No. 2 on the US Mainstream Rock list.

John Poulos: John Poulos (born March 31, 1947) was the original drummer for The Buckinghams.  He was a founding member of the Chicago area band in 1965.  His mother Ann and his father John Sr.,were very proud of their youngest child in a family of solid Greek heritage.  He graduated from Roosevelt High School in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois in 1965.  Lead guitar player Carl Giammarese lived only a few blocks away from John Poulos in the Albany Park neighborhood of Chicago.  His nickname since his late teens was ""Jon Jon"". John Poulos was the leader of a high school band in Chicago called ""The Pulsations"".  He approached singers George LeGros and  Dennis Tufano who sang harmonies in an acapella group called The Darsals to come join his band,""The Pulsations"".  Local Chicago-area deejay and booking agent @ Willard - Alexander agency Carl Bonafede attests to the fact that Jon Jon personally recruited singers Dennis Tufano and his close friend George Legros at Gordon Tech high school to the band Jon Jon Poulos approached Carl Bonafede head deejay who spun records for Dan Belloc's dances at the Holiday ballroom about becoming the manager of John's high school band ""The Pulsations"".  When USA Records released The Buckinghams from their contract, the band had a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 charts with Kind of a Drag.  The members voted to part ways with personal manager Carl Bonafede.  Jon Jon Poulos and Dennis Tufano flew out to Los Angeles to meet with James William Guercio to seek management and a new record deal.  The meeting with Guercio led to The Buckinghams signing a new record contract with Columbia Records.  John went into the music management side of the music business after the Buckinghams agreed to part ways in 1970.  John managed his fellow ex-Buckinghams Carl Giammarese and Dennis Tufano when they formed a duo called ""Tufano & Giammarese"".  ""When The Buckinghams broke up in 1970 and Nick departed for a career in R&B and Marty wanted to go a different direction, Dennis Tufano and Carl decided to form a duo, Dennis and Carl.  We put together a demo CD, with the help of Peter Shelton and his wife, and John determined to manage us and find us a recording deal.  Reaching for the stars, he reached a zenith: John brought us to Ode Records, where we signed with Lou Adler, became “Tufano and Giammarese” and spent 7 years of our career together.""  John Poulos managed several other Illinois bands, most notably a band from the Fox River Grove area called Boyzz from Illinois.  He died of heart failure in his Chicago home just short of his 33rd birthday in 1980.  Carl Bonafede maintains there never would have been a Buckinghams band if not for the commitment of Jon Jon Poulos.  His love of music and dedication to the band was unique.  He often shared discussion of the business side of music with ""the Screaming Wildman"".  John had one child, a daughter, Polly who was born in September 1970.

In 1906, the ""Maple Leaf"" was the only Canadian vessel to qualify for the first ever Trans-Pac sailing race, which was slated to take place in San Francisco but never took place due to the massive earthquake that occurred in that year.  From the 1930s to the 1970s, the ""Maple Leaf"" was a halibut longliner on the Bering Sea, making it one of the longest-running ships to fish. Debut (Björk album): Debut is the first international solo studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk.  The album was released in July 1993 on One Little Indian and Elektra Records, and was produced by Björk in collaboration with artist Nellee Hooper.  Her first recording following the dissolution of her previous band the Sugarcubes, the album departed from the rock-oriented style of her previous work and instead drew on an eclectic variety of styles across electronic pop, house music, jazz and trip hop. Souled Out (1998): Souled Out (1998) was the second Souled Out professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and sponsored by Snickers.  Unlike the previous year's event, this year's event was billed as a joint production by WCW and the nWo (in storyline) and the pay-per-view events until the following year's Uncensored were jointly produced by WCW and the nWo.  The event took place on January 24, 1998 from the Hara Arena in and featured a double main event.  The first main event featured Bret Hart making his WCW in-ring debut against Ric Flair.  Hart made Flair submit to the Sharpshooter.  The second main event featured WCW's Lex Luger against nWo's Randy Savage.  Luger made Savage submit to the ""Torture Rack"". FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2001: The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2001 took place February 15–25, 2001 in Lahti, Finland for a record sixth time, previous events being held in 1926, 1938, 1958, 1978 and 1989.  These championships also saw the most event changes since the 1950s with the 5 km women and 10 km men's events being discontinued, the 10 km women and 15 km men's events return to their normal status for the first time since the 1991 championships, the debut of a combined pursuit as a separate category (5 km + 5 km for women, 10 km + 10 km for men), the addition of the individual sprint race for both genders, and the debut of the ski jumping team normal hill event.  Extremely cold weather (-23 C ) cancelled the women's 30 km event.  The biggest controversy occurred when a doping scandal hit the host nation of Finland, resulting in six disqualifications.  This would serve as a prelude to further doping cases in cross country skiing at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City the following year. FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1950: The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1950 took place during February 1–6, 1950 in Lake Placid, New York, United States and Rumford, Maine, United States.  This was Lake Placid's second time hosting the championships after having done so at the 1932 Winter Olympics.  It also marked the first time after World War II the event took place after the Winter Olympics in a non-Olympic year (St. Moritz, Switzerland hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics two years earlier), the second time the world championships occurred outside Europe, the first time they had occurred outside Europe in a non-Olympic year, and the only time the United States has hosted the event in a non-Olympic year.  The ski-jumping events were held at Lake Placid, while the cross-country skiing events (originally planned to also be held at Lake Placid) were moved to Rumford due to insufficient snow. Holding On to You (Twenty One Pilots song): ""Holding On to You"" is a song written and recorded by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, for their second studio album ""Regional at Best"".  A partially re-recorded version of the song appeared on their third studio album, ""Vessel"".  ""Holding On to You"" was released as the first single from ""Vessel"" in the iTunes Store worldwide on September 11, 2012.  A video for the song was released on November 15.  The video was directed by Jordan Bahat.  The song impacted alternative radio on December 4, 2012, and released to mainstream radio on June 11, 2013.  It is the band's debut single. Vessel (DVD): Vessel is the first live long-form video by Icelandic musician Björk, directed by Stéphane Sednaoui and produced by Elektra Entertainment.  It was released in VHS on 5 September 1994, by One Little Indian, with a DVD reissue taking place on 13 May 2003.  The release documents a concert by the artist during the 1994 tour held in support of her studio album ""Debut"" (1993).  It contains ten songs from the album, in addition to a B-side; an interview with Björk is interspersed throughout the setlist.  ""Vessel"" was subject to mixed reviews from music critics, who had polarizing opinions on both the performances and Sednaoui's editing. 2014–2017 Venezuelan protests: In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls.  While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela Mónica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Cristóbal.  Subsequent arrests and killings of student protestors spurred their expansion to neighboring cities and the involvement of opposition leaders.  The year's early months were characterized by large demonstrations and violent clashes between protestors and government forces that resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests and 43 deaths, including both supporters and opponents of the government.  Toward the end of 2014, and into 2015, continued shortages and low oil prices caused renewed protesting.  By 2016, protests occurred following the controversy surrounding the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections as well as the incidents surrounding the 2016 recall referendum.  On 1 September 2016, the largest demonstration of the protests occurred, with over 1 million Venezuelans, or over 3% of the entire nation's population, gathered to demand a recall election against President Maduro, with the event being described as the ""largest demonstration in the history of Venezuela"".  Following the suspension of the recall referendum by the government-leaning National Electoral Council (CNE) on 21 October 2016, the opposition organized another protest which was held on 26 October 2016, with over 1.2 million Venezuelans participating.  After some of the largest protests occurred in a late-2016, Vatican-mediate dialogue between the opposition and government was attempted and ultimately failed in January 2017.  Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly and removed their immunity, though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew ""into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014"".  The protests are considered to be the Mother of all Protests. Triplemanía XX: Triplemanía XX was a professional wrestling event produced by the AAA promotion, which took place on August 5, 2012, at ""Arena Ciudad de México"" in Mexico City, Mexico.  The event was the twentieth annual ""Triplemanía"", which is AAA's biggest show of the year, and marked AAA's debut in the new ""Arena Ciudad de México"".  The event was headlined by a match between Dr. Wagner Jr. and Máscara Año 2000 Jr., where the loser was forced to unmask himself.  In the semi-main event, El Mesías defended the AAA Mega Championship against the 2012 Rey de Reyes, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo.  The event also featured Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) performer Kurt Angle's AAA debut and an induction into the AAA Hall of Fame.  This event marked the first time in four years that a ""Triplemanía"" was not broadcast live on pay-per-view.  Instead, the event would be broadcast in three parts on AAA's official website, starting August 19.  The event was attended by 21,000 people, the largest crowd for a professional wrestling event in Mexico in almost five years. Ricochet Gathering: Ricochet Gathering is a unique collaboration event for electronic music.  This name applies to the event and also the group of musicians involved in the event, where a group of musicians and a usually small group fans gather at unique locations throughout the world.  The event happens approximately once each calendar year.  The first gathering occurred at the Okefenokee Swamp in April 2000.  Each gathering event has a theme tied to the Berlin School of electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream.

The storm also affected portions of the Southeastern regions of the United States.  This storm came just two weeks after a previous major blizzard severely affected most of these same areas in December 2010.  It was the second significant snowstorm to affect the region during the 2010–11 North American winter storm season. Cyclone Quimburga: Cyclone Quimburga, also referred to as the Lower Saxony Storm was a deadly European windstorm that struck northern and central Europe between 12–14 November 1972.  The storm has been described as one of the most devastating storm events during the 20th century.  The storm also destroyed the Königs Wusterhausen Central Tower, a 243 m communications tower to the southwest of Berlin and the church steeple in Berlin-Friedrichshagen. January 2014 United States blizzard: The January 2014 United States blizzard was a fast-moving but disruptive blizzard that moved through the Northeast, mainly the Mid-Atlantic states, dumping up to 1 ft in areas around the New York City area.  The storm also brought cold temperatures behind it, similar to a snowstorm earlier that month. BLIZZARD! The Storm That Changed America: BLIZZARD!  The Storm That Changed America is a 2000 Children's history book by Jim Murphy.  It is about the Blizzard of 1888 that hit the north-east of North America, and concentrates on New York City. December 2014 North American storm complex: The December 2014 North American storm complex was a powerful winter storm (referred to by some as California's """"Storm of the Decade"""") that impacted the West Coast of the United States, beginning on the night of December 10, 2014, resulting in snow, wind, and flood watches.  Fueled by the Pineapple Express, an atmospheric river originating in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Hawaiian Islands, the storm was the strongest to affect California since January 2010.  The system was also the single most intense storm to impact the West Coast, in terms of minimum low pressure, since a powerful winter storm in January 2008.  The National Weather Service classified the storm as a significant threat, and issued 15 warnings and advisories, including a Blizzard Warning for the Northern Sierra Nevada (the first issued in California since January 2008). Great Blizzard of 1888: The Great Blizzard of 1888 or Great Blizzard of '88 (March 11 – March 14, 1888) was one of the most severe recorded blizzards in the history of the United States of America.  The storm, referred to as the Great White Hurricane, paralyzed the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine, as well as the Atlantic provinces of Canada.  Snowfalls of 20 - fell in parts of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and sustained winds of more than 45 mph produced snowdrifts in excess of 50 ft .  Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their houses for up to a week.  Railway and telegraph lines were disabled, and this provided the impetus to move these pieces of infrastructure underground.  Emergency services were also affected. Hurricane Tina (1992): Hurricane Tina was the strongest and longest-lived storm of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season and threatened land for a brief period.  The twenty-fourth tropical cyclone, twenty-second tropical storm, fourteenth hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the record breaking 1992 season, Tina formed from a tropical wave on September 17.  The storm moved towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane.  A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then re-curved Tina to the northeast and towards land, still moving slowly and gradually slowing down.  The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge.  Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea.  It intensified into a Category 4 storm with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a central pressure of 932 millibars.  Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north.  Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11, shortly after entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility.  Although the tropical cyclone never made landfall, heavy rains were recorded across western Mexico.  While at peak intensity, the storm also displayed annular characteristics. North American blizzard of 2008: The North American blizzard of 2008 was a winter storm that struck most of southern and eastern North America from March 6 to March 10, 2008.  The storm was most notable for a major winter storm event from Arkansas to Quebec.  It also produced severe weather across the east coast of the United States with heavy rain, damaging winds and tornadoes, causing locally significant damage.  The hardest hit areas by the wintry weather were from the Ohio Valley to southern Quebec where up to a half a meter of snow fell locally including the major cities of Columbus, Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio, and Ottawa, Ontario.  For many areas across portions of the central United States, Ontario and Quebec, it was the worst winter storm in the past several years.  The blizzard and its aftermath caused at least 17 deaths across four US states and three Canadian provinces, while hundreds others were injured mostly in weather-related accidents and tornadoes. February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard: The February 25–27, 2010 North American blizzard (also known as the ""Snowicane"") was a winter storm and severe weather event that occurred in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States between February 24–26, 2010.  The storm dropped its heaviest snow of 12 to (locally as much as 36 in ) across a wide area of interior New England, New York, and Pennsylvania.  The storm also brought flooding rains to coastal sections of New England, with some areas experiencing as much as 4 in .  Aside from precipitation, the Nor'easter brought hurricane-force sustained winds to coastal New England. January 25–27, 2011 North American blizzard: The January 25–27, 2011 North American blizzard was a major Mid-Atlantic nor'easter and winter storm, and a New England blizzard that affected portions of the northeastern United States and Canada.  This storm came just two weeks after a previous major blizzard had already affected most of these same areas earlier on the same month of January 2011.  The storm also came just one month after a previous major blizzard that affected the entire area after Christmas in December 2010.  This storm was the third significant snowstorm to affect the region during the 2010–11 North American winter storm season.  It was followed a few days later by another massive storm that blanketed much of the United States and Canada.

His 2011 single ""In My City"" featuring Efrain from Doubledge also garnered attention, as did his appearance on the song ""Reverse"" by Tedashii from ""Blacklight"".  He signed to Reach Records in 2011 and dropped his stage name ""C-Lite"" in favor of his legal name.  Under this name he released another mixtape, ""Formerly Known"", in 2011.  In May 2012 he debuted a four episode web series entitled ""Saturday Morning Car-Tunez"" in which he remixed classic hip hop songs.  The four songs were subsequently released for free as a compilation album.  His debut full-length studio album, ""Heroes for Sale"", was released April 2013.
