The Defence Strategic Policy and Intelligence Group is led by the Deputy Secretary for Strategic Policy and Intelligence and comprises four policy divisions and three intelligence agencies, which are the Australian Defence Organisation members of the Australian Intelligence Community. British intelligence agencies: The Government of the United Kingdom maintains intelligence agencies within several different government departments.  The agencies are responsible for collecting and producing foreign and domestic intelligence, providing military intelligence, performing espionage and counter-espionage.  Their intelligence assessments contribute to the conduct of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom, maintaining the national security of the United Kingdom, military planning and law enforcement in the United Kingdom.  The three main agencies are the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the Security Service (MI5), and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Gustav Laabs: Gustav Laabs (born 20 December 1902-died 12 March 1980) was a German SS commander during the Nazi era.  During the Second World War, he worked as a gas van operator at the Chełmno extermination camp in Wartheland.  As an operator of a gas van, Laabs was directly involved in and responsible for the genocidal extermination of over 100,000 men, women and children, most of whom were killed on account of being Jewish.  After the war, he was tried and convicted for his crimes against humanity.  Despite being convicted, Laabs was given the lenient sentence of 15 years (subsequently reduced to 13 years) by a regional court in Landgericht Bonn, Germany.  Far from being outliers, such instances of leniency, extended to perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity during trials in post-Nazi Germany, constituted the norm, as evidenced by the fact that most of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes and the Final Solution were not brought to justice.  Many former SS officers and Nazis, who were directly responsible for perpetrating genocide and murdering countless innocent people, were contracted to work for US and British intelligence agencies as part of the war against the USSR and Communism (also see Operation Paperclip for more on post-WWII Allied collaboration with Nazis). Alliance Base: Alliance Base was the cover name for a secret Western Counterterrorist Intelligence Center (CTIC) that existed between 2002 and 2009 in Paris.  The existence of CTICs were first revealed by Dana Priest in a November 17, 2005 ""Washington Post"" article, while she referred to the Alliance Base in a July 2, 2005, article.  The name was chosen in reference of Al Qaeda, which means ""The Base"" in Arabic.  It was headed by a French General assigned to the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), and largely funded by the CIA's Counterterrorist Center.  It hosted officers from Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and the United States and was used for intelligence exchange and operational planning.  Its existence was confirmed on 8 September 2006 by Christophe Chaboud, chief of the UCLAT (""""Unité de Coordination de la Lutte contre le Terrorisme"""", ""Fight against Terrorism Coordination Unit""), in an interview to RFI.  Although intelligence exchange between intelligence agencies has become more and more widespread in the last decade, in particular following the September 11, 2001 attacks, this organisation also engaged in operations. Yulin Naval Base: Yulin Naval Base () is a naval base for nuclear submarines along the southern coast of Hainan Island, People's Republic of China.  This underground base has been reported by several intelligence agencies, especially Indian agencies.  The images collected by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) in February 2008 shows that China constructed a large scale underground base for its naval forces. Ardeshir Reporter: Sir Ardeshir Reporter was born in a Zoroastrian Parsee family in Bombay on August 22, 1865.  He was a secret British Intelligence agent in Iran for many years.  In fact, he lived and worked in Iran as a secret British Intelligence agent since 1893.  He came to Iran under the cover of Times' reporter.  It was he who introduced General Ironside to Reza Khan, and it was Ironside who encouraged Reza Khan to seize power.  According to his own will, he was the one, who discovered Reza Khan and guided him in the coup on February 22, 1921.  Therefore he was instrumental in Reza Khan’s 1921 military coup and the consequent establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty and enthronement of Reza Shah in Iran in 1925.  Ardeshir Reporter died in Tehran in 1933.  His son, Shapoor Reporter, was also a secret agent of the British Intelligence Service in Iran who served the Pahlavi family after Reza Shah's death. Australian Secret Intelligence Service: The Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS; ) is Australia's foreign intelligence agency.  ASIS was formed in 1952, but its existence remained secret even within the Government until 1972.  ASIS is part of the Australian Intelligence Community responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence, including both counter-intelligence and liaising with the intelligence agencies of other countries.  In these roles, ASIS is comparable to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Defense Intelligence Agency in popular culture: The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is a military espionage organization of the United States and one of the country's national-level intelligence agencies under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).  Less known than its non-DoD equivalent or its cryptologic counterpart, the DIA and its personnel have at times been portrayed in works of American popular culture.  As with other U.S. foreign intelligence organizations, the agency's role has occasionally been confused with those of law enforcement agencies. Government Communications Headquarters: The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is an intelligence and security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance to the government and armed forces of the United Kingdom.  Based in ""The Doughnut"" in the suburbs of Cheltenham, GCHQ is the responsibility of the country's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, but it is not a part of the Foreign Office and its director ranks as a Permanent Secretary. Israel's Secret Wars: It explores the role of secret intelligence and covert activities in the Zionist movement before independence and explore the operational and political histories all three major Israeli intelligence agencies Aman (military intelligence), Mossad (foreign intelligence and covert operations) and Shin Bet (internal security).

It is served by the Tung Chung Line and West Rail Line and provides cross-platform interchange between platform 1 (West Rail Line towards Tuen Mun) and platform 4 (Tung Chung Line towards Hong Kong).  The livery of Nam Cheong Station is pale yellow green. Mei Foo Station: Mei Foo () is a Hong Kong MTR station located in Mei Foo Sun Chuen, Lai Chi Kok, New Kowloon.  It is an interchange station between the Tsuen Wan Line and the West Rail Line, situated between Lai Chi Kok and Lai King stations on the Tsuen Wan Line and Nam Cheong Station and Tsuen Wan West stations on the West Rail Line.  Mei Foo Station's livery is blue. Yuen Long Station: Yuen Long () is an MTR station located in the northeastern part of Yuen Long Town, Yuen Long District, between Kam Sheung Road and Long Ping stations on the West Rail Line.  It is an interchange between the West Rail Line and the Light Rail Yuen Long Stop. West Rail Line: The West Rail Line () is one of the MTR lines in Hong Kong, indicated by the colour dark magenta.  It was formerly known as the KCR West Rail (九廣西鐵 ).  The line connects Hung Hom Station in Kowloon and Tuen Mun Station in Tuen Mun, 35.7 km away, in 37 minutes.  The railway runs through the cities of Kowloon, Castle Peak and Tsuen Wan. East Rail Line: The East Rail Line () is one of eleven railway lines of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong.  It used to be one of the three lines of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR) network.  It was known as the KCR British Section (九廣鐵路英段) from 1910 to 1996, and the KCR East Rail (九廣東鐵) from 1996 to 2007.  The East Rail was the only railway line of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) before the construction of ""KCR West Rail"" (now known as West Rail Line). Canton Road Station: Canton Road Station (Trad.  Chinese: 廣東道站) was a planned railway station on the Kowloon Southern Link of West Rail Line between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Austin Station, beneath the shopping mall, Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui, by replacing the existing underground car park.  But it was never to be built because of the failed negotiations between the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), the former developer of the station, and The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, the owner of the Harbour City. Austin Station (MTR): Austin () is an underground MTR rapid transit station on the West Rail Line in Hong Kong, situated perpendicular to Wui Cheung Road and Austin Road West, and formerly adjacent to Jordan Road Ferry Pier Bus Terminus.  It is the only intermediate station along the Kowloon Southern Link project, built to connect the West Rail Line and East Rail Line.  Construction was finished in July 2009 and the station opened on 16 August 2009. Tuen Mun South Extension: Tuen Mun South Extension is a proposed extension of the West Rail Line to the Tuen Mun South () station in the vicinities of Tuen Mun Ferry Pier.  This station will serve as the future West Rail Line westbound terminus if built.  The extension will extend southwards from the current western terminus Tuen Mun Station.  The journey time from Tuen Mun South to Tuen Mun is estimated to be approximately 4 minutes.  It is planned to run on viaduct, since if it were to continue underground the gradient would be too steep for the trains to run through. Kowloon Southern Link: The Kowloon Southern Link is a section of the MTR West Rail Line, linking Nam Cheong Station and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station.  The rail link is fully underground, lies along the south-west coastline of Kowloon Peninsula, east of rail tracks of the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express.  Kowloon Southern Link has one underground intermediate station called Austin Station (formerly West Kowloon Station).  It is located adjacent to the Canton Road Government Offices, close to Kowloon Station of Tung Chung Line and Airport Express.  However, the structures do not provide a direct transfer between the two stations. Harbour City (Hong Kong): Harbour City is a large shopping mall in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong.  It is part of a series of office blocks and hotels.  It comprises several parts: Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, Ocean Terminal, Ocean Centre (with 1980s retro decor), the Gateway and the Pacific Club Kowloon.  The complex is located along the west side of Canton Road, stretching from the Star Ferry Pier in the south to China Hong Kong City in the north.

What type of species is a Boreo-arctic Montane species found in the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of the Earth?,Carabus glabratus,Carabus glabratus is a beetle.,Beetle,"I apologize for any confusion caused. Based on the given context, the species described as a Boreo-arctic Montane species found in the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of the Earth is Carabus glabratus.","Apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood the question. Based on the context provided, the Boreo-arctic Montane species found in the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude on Earth's maps is the Arctic Circle.","Based on the information provided in the context, the Boreo-arctic Montane species mentioned is Carabus glabratus, which is a species of beetle. It is found in Central Europe and Northern Europe north to the Arctic Circle. Therefore, the correct answer is a beetle.","Geographical zone: The five main latitude regions of the Earth's surface comprise geographical zones, divided by the major circles of latitude.  The differences between them relate to climate.  They are as follows: Carabus glabratus: Carabus glabratus is a species of beetle.  It is a Boreo-arctic Montane species widespread in Central Europe and Northern Europe north to the Arctic Circle. Smerinthus minor: Smerinthus minor (lesser eyed hawkmoth) is a moth of the family Sphingidae.  It was described by Mell in 1937.  It is a montane species found from the Taibai Shan area, western Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China eastwards along the Qinling to southern Shanxi and then north to just west of Beijing.  It has also been recorded from the Miaofeng Mountains near Beijing and the Wuling Mountains in Hunan. Ulmus glabra: Ulmus glabra, the wych elm, Scotch elm or Scots elm, has the widest range of the European elm species, from Ireland eastwards to the Urals, and from the Arctic Circle south to the mountains of the Peloponnese in Greece; it is also found in Iran.  A large, deciduous tree, it is essentially a montane species, growing at elevations of up to 1500 m, preferring sites with moist soils and high humidity.  The tree can form pure forests in Scandinavia and occurs as far north as latitude 67°N at Beiarn in Norway.  Wych elm has also been successfully introduced to Narsarsuaq, near the southern tip of Greenland (61°N). Arctic Circle (disambiguation): Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. Porthecla peruensis: Porthecla peruensis is a butterfly in the Lycaenidae family.  It is found in northern Peru, on the east side of the Andes.  It appears to be a montane species, since it has only been found at altitudes above 1,500 meters. Amietia wittei: Amietia wittei (common name: Molo frog) is a species of frog in the Pyxicephalidae family.  It is found in Kenya, Tanzania, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Its type locality is in Molo, Kenya, located near the top of the Mau Escarpment.  It is a common species associated with montane grasslands, perhaps forests, and also found in a town.  It is found in the Kenyan central highlands and northern Tanzania in the East African montane moorlands and the East African montane forests ecoregions. Antarctic Circle: The Antarctic Circle is the most southerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth.  The region south of this circle is known as the Antarctic, and the zone immediately to the north is called the Southern Temperate Zone.  South of the Antarctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and (at least partially) below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not fully visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Circle. Arctic Circle: The Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of the Earth.  It marks the northernmost point at which the noon sun is just visible on the northern winter solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun is just visible on the northern summer solstice.  The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone.  North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle. Nepenthes attenboroughii: Nepenthes attenboroughii ( or ), or Attenborough's pitcher plant, is a montane species of carnivorous pitcher plant of the genus ""Nepenthes"".  It is named after the celebrated broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who is a keen enthusiast of the genus.  The species is characterised by its large and distinctive bell-shaped lower and upper pitchers and narrow, upright lid.  The type specimen of ""N. attenboroughii"" was collected on the summit of Mount Victoria, an ultramafic mountain in central Palawan, the Philippines.

Huntington argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that Islamic extremism would become the biggest threat to world peace.  It was proposed in a 1992 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 ""Foreign Affairs"" article titled ""The Clash of Civilizations?"" , in response to his former student Francis Fukuyama's 1992 book, ""The End of History and the Last Man"".

Inventing the AIDS Virus: Inventing the AIDS Virus is a 1996 book by molecular biologist Peter Duesberg, in which the author argues that HIV does not cause AIDS.

The unambiguous scientific consensus is that HIV causes AIDS and that Duesberg's claims are incorrect.  Duesberg received a negative response from the scientific community for supporting AIDS denialism, misrepresenting and ignoring the scientific evidence that HIV causes AIDS, and for relying upon poor logic and manipulation.  Duesberg's book was also the subject of an authorship dispute with one of his graduate students.

He is the first man from the Czech Republic to join the professional sport in Japan.  He reached the third highest ""makushita"" division in 2004, but due to his light weight he had difficulty in regularly beating his opponents, despite his skill.  However, in May 2011 he finally earned promotion to the ""sekitori"" ranks.  After becoming only the third new ""sekitori"" since 1958 to pass through ""jūryō"" division in just one tournament, he made his debut in the top ""makuuchi"" division in September 2011.  He retired on 24 July 2014. Cardboard record: A cardboard record was a type of cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard.  These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell.  Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability.  These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and from many of the old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose. Al-Ca composite: Al-Ca composite is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite consisting of sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix.  The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.  It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed.  Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission.  Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type.  This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors.  This eliminates the ""bird caging"", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands.  The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys.  The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.  Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs.  The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations.  The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses. Maximum Fighting Championship: Maximum Fighting Championship is a Canadian mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion based in Edmonton, Alberta.  MFC’s former home, in Canada, is the River Cree Resort and Casino in Enoch, Alberta, located just outside Edmonton, Alberta but has also held events at the Edmonton Expo Centre.  MFC events are broadcast on The Fight Network, AXS TV (formerly HDnet) in North America and most recently TSN2.  MFC is known to be the biggest MMA promotion in Canada and one of the top MMA shows in the World.  MFC has notable Canadian fighters, such as Ryan Jimmo, Graham Spencer, Tom Watson and Douglas Lima, plus MMA veterans, such as Jason MacDonald, Thales Leites, Jay Silva, Trevor Prangley, and Paul Daley. MNOS (operating system): MNOS (meaning ""MobilNaya Operatsionnaya Sistema"" (МобильНая Операционная Система, МНОС), or ""Portable Operating System"") was a Unix-like operating system developed in the Soviet Union.  It was derived from Version 6 Unix and consequently heavily modified to incorporate many features of BSD Unix.  From 1983 until 1986 it enjoyed significant popularity in the USSR and other Eastern Bloc countries, due to its light weight and better performance than that of Version 7 Unix (and later BSD Unix-based) alternatives. Trevor Prangley: Trevor Prangley (born 24 August 1972) is a South African mixed martial artist.  He has fought in the UFC, Strikeforce, Bellator, Dream, King of the Cage, MFC, the SFL, Shark Fights, and Bodog Fight.  He competed in the Middleweight and Light Heavyweight divisions.  He was the former King of the Cage Light Heavyweight Champion, the former Shark Fights Light Heavyweight Champion, and the former MFC Light Heavyweight Champion. Wrightspeed X1: The Wrightspeed X1 is a one-off Ariel Atom heavily modified to use an all-electric powertrain.  The Atom was chosen for its light weight and efficient design.  The electric motor and inverter are sourced from AC Propulsion, makers of the TZero concept car, while the batteries are low weight, high energy density lithium ion provided from A123 Systems.  As with the ""Atom"" the transmission is a Honda unit, but stripped of its shifting mechanism and other parts to provide only the second gear speed, allowed by the wide speed and torque range available from the electric motor. Middleweight (MMA): The middleweight division in mixed martial arts refers to different weight classes: Medium Tank M7: The Medium Tank M7 was originally conceived as an up-gunned replacement for the Light Tank M3/M5.  The project was supposed to mount the same 75mm armament as the M4 Sherman while retaining the light weight and maneuverability of the M3 Stuart; however, during development the weight of the prototype surpassed the US Army's standard for light tanks and crossed into the medium category and was renamed.  The M7 had significantly less armor than the M4 Sherman, boasted no greater firepower, and held only a slight advantage in top speed.  For these reasons, and because the M4 was already battle-tested and in full production, the M7 was put aside shortly after completing trials. Terao Tsunefumi: Terao Tsunefumi (寺尾 常史 , born February 2, 1963 as Yoshifumi Fukuzono 福薗 好文) is a Japanese former sumo wrestler.  He was born in Tokyo, but brought up in Kajiki, Aira District, Kagoshima, Japan.  He fought out of Izutsu stable.  The highest rank he reached was ""sekiwake.""  Despite his relatively light weight he had an extremely long career, spanning 23 years from 1979 until 2002, and was known as the ""iron man"" of sumo.  He is now the head coach of Shikoroyama stable.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.","Northwestern University: Northwestern University (NU) is a private research university based in Evanston, Illinois, with other campuses located in Chicago and Doha, Qatar, and academic programs and facilities in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, California. Duane Park: Duane Park is a small, triangular public urban park located in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  The park is bordered by Hudson Street to the east and branches of Duane Street on north and south sides. Duane Banks Field: Duane Banks Field is a baseball stadium in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.  It is the home field of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes college baseball team.  The stadium holds 3,000 people and opened in 1974.  It is named after former Iowa Hawkeyes baseball coach Duane Banks.  The field was renamed in honor of Banks in 2001.  The school has added lights to the field recently, and some high school games are also played there. Black Sun Ensemble: Black Sun Ensemble is a Tucson, Arizona, US–based psychedelic rock band, led by Jesus Acedo that was formed in the mid-1980s.  The initial albums garnered rave reviews from Rolling Stone and several of the independent music journals of the time.  Black Sun Ensemble opened for Camper Van Beethoven on the ""Key Lime Pie"" tour in 1989 to appreciative audiences across North America.  Infamous circumstances surrounding their Geffen Records showcase in Los Angeles lead to the quiet intervention of Paul McCartney to get certain members and their entourage out of custody- a tarot card was involved, but any more may detail may arouse the attorneys!  (based on statements from Jesus Acedo & Duane Norman).  Additionally, the bloody death of a goat in the audience at the 1994 Burning Man festival lead to widespread public outcry and condemnation from animal rights group PETA.  The band was forced underground and splintered, reformed and fell into hiatus due to extenuating circumstances and the mental illness of Jesus Acedo.  Mickey Rourke, a close friend to Jesus Acedo at the time, was urged by friends and family to visit Acedo in his dreams embodying the dark angel, compelling him to resume writing.  This was the inspiration for the song, ""Murder"" (showcased on the October 29, 2015 episode of Shonda Rimes' ABC hit show How to Get Away with Murder).  Furthermore, if Mickey Rourke bestows a mood ring upon you, you take it. Swank diet: The Swank Diet is a diet that is low in saturated fat, which was proposed in 1949 by Roy Laver Swank, MD, PhD (1909–2008), academic neurologist at the University of Oregon, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The Resident: The Resident is a 2011 British thriller film directed by Antti Jokinen and starring Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  Swank stars as a recently single woman who rents an apartment in New York City and comes to suspect that someone is stalking her.  The film also features a cameo from Hammer Films star Christopher Lee, in his first collaboration with the studio since 1976's ""To the Devil a Daughter"" and his last before his death in 2015. Duane, New York: Duane is a town in Franklin County, New York, United States.  The population was 174 at the 2010 census.  The town is named after James Duane, a developer and grandson of New York City mayor James Duane. Goldenrod Records: Goldenrod Records was a record label formed by Tod Swank in 1991 in San Diego, California to release the first 7"" record by Custom Floor, a band consisting of skateboarders Garry Davis, Phil Esbenshade, and Miki Vuckovich.  After the release of the Custom Floor record, Swank's other project, Foundation Skateboards, gained some financial momentum, and Goldenrod was put on hold.  Swank's friend Mark Waters, an employee at Lou's Records at the time, and also a photographer and writer in the skateboarding world, was looking to start a record label and asked Swank for advice.  A partnership was born and the ""no rules for records"" idea was spawned.  Basically, this meant that if they liked a band, they'd put out a record if they could, without worrying about how many would sell.  A long series of releases by primarily San Diego bands followed, and several noteworthy San Diego bands made their debut on Goldenrod Records: No Knife, Heavy Vegetable, Boilermaker, 100 Watt Halo, The Crimson Curse, etc.  Other notable bands who released records on Goldenrod include Three Mile Pilot, fluf, Supernova, Tina, Age 13, Big Drill Car, Hemlock, Lucy's Fur Coat, Fishwife, Deadbolt.  Cars Get Crushed and more.  Although technically the label still exists, the only release since 1998 was ""What Is Your?""  by Waters' band Contribution in 2004. D.

Based on the provided context, Ottokar Kernstock wrote the song that was sung to the famous tune of the composer known as the ""Father of the Symphony,"" Joseph Haydn.","Sei gesegnet ohne Ende: ""Sei gesegnet ohne Ende"" (English translation: ""Be Blessed Without End""), also known as the ″Kernstock-Hymne″, is a German language song that was the national anthem of Austria from 1929 until 1938.  Written by Ottokar Kernstock, it was sung to the famous tune of ""Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser"" by Joseph Haydn that is also used for the ""Deutschlandlied"", since 1922 the national anthem of Germany. Joseph Haydn: (Franz) Joseph Haydn ( ; ] ; 31 March 173231 May 1809) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period.  He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets ""Father of the Symphony"" and ""Father of the String Quartet"". Alexander Alyabyev: Alexander Aleksandrovich Alyabyev (Russian: Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Аля́бьев ; 15 August [O.S. 4 August] 1787 6 March [O.S. 22 February] 1851 ), also rendered as Alabiev or Alabieff, was a Russian composer known as one of the fathers of the Russian art song.  He wrote seven operas, twenty musical comedies, a symphony, three string quartets, more than 200 songs, and many other pieces. Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven): The Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op.  125, is the final complete symphony composed from 1822 to 1824 by the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven.  It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824.  The symphony is one of the best-known works in common practice music.  It is widely viewed by critics as one of Beethoven's greatest works, the pinnacle of musical Classicism, and one of the greatest compositions in the western musical canon.  The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony (thus making it a choral symphony).  The words are sung during the final movement by four vocal soloists and a chorus.  They were taken from the ""Ode to Joy"", a poem written by Friedrich Schiller in 1785 and revised in 1803, with text additions made by the composer.  In the 2010s, it stands as one of the most performed symphonies in the world. When a Child Is Born: ""When A Child Is Born"" is a popular Christmas song.  The original melody was ""Soleado"", a tune from 1974 by (alias Zacar), composer for Italy's Daniel Sentacruz Ensemble, and Dario Baldan Bembo.  The tune was based on Damicco's earlier tune ""Le rose blu"" published in 1972.  The English language lyrics were written a few years later by Fred Jay (Friedrich Alex Jacobson IPI number 00015195204, who wrote many hits for Boney M such as Rasputin and Ma Baker).  They do not make specific mention of Christmas but the importance they attach to looking forward to the birth of one particular child somewhere, anywhere, suggests a reference to the birth of Jesus Christ, and the citing of ""a tiny star"" that ""lights up way up high"" may allude to the Star of Bethlehem.  Fred Jay's lyrics have been sung by many artists, most successfully by Johnny Mathis in 1976. Tina Guo: Tina Guo () (born 28 October 1985 in Shanghai, China) is a Chinese-American cellist and erhuist from Shanghai.  She has developed an international multi-faceted performance and recording career as a cellist, electric cellist, erhuist, and composer known for her distinctive sound, videos that showcase her talent against theatrical backdrops and elaborate costumes, mastery in a wide range of genres, and improvisatory style in major motion picture, television, and game scores.  At age five, she moved to the United States.  She has appeared as a soloist with the San Diego Symphony the National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico), the Thessaloniki State Symphony in Greece, the in Brazil, and the Vancouver Island Symphony in British Columbia.  She also performed with violinist Midori Goto in Dvorak's American String Quartet at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and completed four national tours of Mexico and Italy performing the Shostakovich, Dvorak, Haydn, and Saint-Saëns Cello Concertos.

In June 2015, She performed as a guest soloist at the 2015 Kraków Film Festival in Poland. Lloyd George Knew My Father (song): ""Lloyd George Knew My Father"" is a 20th-century English schoolboy folk song.  The simple lyrics consist of the phrase """"Lloyd George knew my father/Father knew Lloyd George"""" sung to the tune ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"".  In the schoolboy song, the two lines referring to Lloyd George are repeated incessantly, typically by groups of schoolboys on a bus or similar setting, until boredom sets in.  There are no lyrics other than those two lines.  The song gains much of its notoriety from the irony inevitable in the clash between the song's flippant lyrics and Sabine Baring-Gould's classic hymn from which Arthur Sullivan's tune is inextricable.  It is also commonly sung to the tune of ""Land of Hope and Glory"". Wilson Sawyer: Wilson Sawyer (1917–1979) was an American composer, arranger and musician.  Born in Traverse City, Michigan, he showed musical talent at an early age and studied music at the University of Michigan.  Sawyer conducted the University's Women's Glee Club and led the Bill Sawyer Orchestra, a big band that was featured on WMAQ's ""Fitch Summer Bandwagon"" on July 7, 1940.  He composed several arrangements of choral works; popular songs for Perry Como, Fred Waring and Ray Eberle; music for the ""Alaskan Stampede,"" a Leo Seltzer produced ""musical extravaganza on ice"" c. 1944, and an opera based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.  He is best known for composing Symphony No. 1, known as the Alaskan Symphony, at Gypsy Trail, Carmel, New York in 1945.  The work includes text from the ""Spell of the Yukon"" by Robert W. Service sung by a baritone soloist in the third movement, as well as other thematic inspirations drawn from his study of the climate, topography and history of the then-territory.  The Alaskan Symphony was first performed in December 1945 by the American Symphony Orchestra and was broadcast across the United States and to overseas armed services at that time.  Wilson Sawyer conducted the piece and Gov. Ernest Gruening of Alaska was guest speaker on the program.  At Gruening's request, the original score was placed in the Alaskan Museum of Natural History [Alaska Historical Library and Museum] in Juneau, Alaska.  In 1960, Sawyer's wife Maxine was diagnosed with spinal cancer and they moved to Pawling, New York where he operated a chicken farm and laundromat.  He continued to compose.  The Alaskan Symphony was performed by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic in 1975 with Sawyer again conducting even though he had recently suffered a stroke.  Sawyer revised the Symphony in 1977, making substantial cuts to the fourth movement among other edits.  The revised Alaskan Symphony was premiered by the Juneau Symphony on June 14, 2008, conducted by music director Kyle Wiley Pickett. Solidarity Forever: ""Solidarity Forever"", written by Ralph Chaplin in 1915, is perhaps the most famous union anthem.  It is sung to the tune of ""John Brown's Body"" and ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"".  Although it was written as a song for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), other union movements, such as the AFL-CIO, have adopted the song as their own.  The song has been performed by musicians such as Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, and was redone by Emcee Lynx and The Nightwatchman.  It is still commonly sung at union meetings and rallies in the United States, Australia and Canada, and has also been sung at conferences of the Australian Labor Party and the Canadian New Democratic Party.  This may have also inspired the hymn of the consumer cooperative movement, ""The Battle Hymn of Cooperation"", which is sung to the same tune. W. de Wycombe: W. de Wycombe (Wicumbe, and perhaps Whichbury) (late thirteenth century) was an English composer and copyist of the Medieval era.  He was precentor of the priory of Leominster in Herefordshire.  It is possible that he was the composer of the most famous tune from medieval England, ""Sumer is icumen in"".

"1979, is a song by American alternative rock band, the Smashing Pumpkins, the second single from their third studio album, was released on October 23, 1995 in the UK, is titled?","""1979""","""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness""",Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,"Apologies for the confusion caused by my previous response. ""1979"" is indeed a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. It was released as the second single from their third studio album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"", on October 23, 1995. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.","Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. To clarify, the song ""1979"" by The Smashing Pumpkins was released as the second single from their third studio album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"". The album itself was released on October 23, 1995, in the United Kingdom.","Apologies, but I made an error in my previous response. ""1979"" is actually the second single from The Smashing Pumpkins' third studio album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"", which was released on October 23, 1995 in the UK.","Muzzle (song): ""Muzzle"" is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins from their third album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"".  It was one of the last songs written by Billy Corgan for ""Mellon Collie"", with the song's lyrics referring to what Corgan thought the public's perception was of him at the time.  It was rumored to be the Smashing Pumpkins fifth and final single from this album, as is evidenced by the fact that a promotional single for the song was issued to radio stations worldwide.  However, the song ""Thirty-Three"" was released as the fifth and final single instead. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the third studio album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, released on October 23, 1995 in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States on Virgin Records.  Produced by frontman Billy Corgan with Flood and Alan Moulder, the 28-track album was released as a two-disc CD and triple LP.  The album features a wide array of styles, as well as greater musical input from bassist D'arcy Wretzky and second guitarist James Iha. Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album): Zeitgeist is the seventh album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, released on July 10, 2007 in the United States and Canada.  It was the first album The Smashing Pumpkins released after their 2000 disbandment and 2005 reunion.  The album was produced by Roy Thomas Baker, Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Terry Date.  The album would be Chamberlin's last with the band before his departure in 2009.  The album debuted strongly, but sales soon decreased, and critical reception was mixed.  It was certified Gold in the United States on February 1, 2008. Rotten Apples: Rotten Apples (The Smashing Pumpkins - Greatest Hits as titled on the album's cover) is a greatest hits compilation album by alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins.  In the US, it was released in 2001 along with a bonus disc titled ""Judas O"".  The album's concluding track, ""Untitled"", was the Pumpkins' final recording before their breakup.  Completed in the days leading up to the band's farewell concert at the Metro in Chicago, it was also released as a single.  Another notable track is ""Real Love""; while previously released on ""Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music"", this was taken from the factory master tapes and, as a result, lacks the pops and clicks inherent in all copies of ""Machina II"" (which is vinyl sourced). G.L.O.W. (song): ""G.L.O.W."" is a song by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins.  It premiered on Chicago alternative rock station Q101 on September 29, 2008.  This song was the last recorded Smashing Pumpkins song to feature drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, who left the band in March 2009. The End Is the Beginning Is the End: ""The End Is the Beginning Is the End"" is a Grammy Award-winning song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins.  It is the first full-band song released as a single by the Smashing Pumpkins in the aftermath of their 1995 album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"".  It is their first release with drummer Matt Walker, who later drummed on several tracks of ""Adore"" and all of James Iha's ""Let It Come Down"".  The song won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. 1979 (song): ""1979"" is a song by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins.  Released in 1996 as the second single from their third studio album, ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"", ""1979"" was written by frontman Billy Corgan, and features loops and samples that were uncharacteristic of previous Smashing Pumpkins songs.  The song was written as a coming of age story by Corgan.  In the year 1979, Corgan was 12 and this is what he considered his transition into adolescence.  The song was popular with critics and fans; Allmusic's Amy Hanson called it a ""somewhat surprising hit"".  The song was nominated for the Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, and won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video.  In 2012, it was voted the second-best Smashing Pumpkins song by Rolling Stone magazine readers. Range Life (song): ""Range Life"" is a song by Pavement, the third single from their 1994 album ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"".  The song attracted attention with controversial lyrics that seemed to mock alternative rock superstars the Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots; Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan expressed his displeasure in magazine interviews, while songwriter Stephen Malkmus maintained that his words had been misinterpreted and no insult was intended.  Regardless, Pavement, which was due to tour for Lollapalooza in 1994, got kicked out when the Smashing Pumpkins, the headlining act, threatened to cancel their Lollapalooza dates if Pavement played.  Pavement would eventually play Lollapalooza the next year.  An early 1993 demo of the song did not feature this verse; guitarist Spiral Stairs recalled in 2004 that when Malkmus first revealed these new lyrics to his bandmates at the New York City recording sessions for ""CRCR"", ""we almost lost our lunch from laughing so much.""  The single was not commercially released in the USA; it was issued by the band's UK label at the time, Big Cat.  Both B-sides are outtakes from the ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"" sessions and are included on the 2004 of that album.  This song was one of many to be included in the group's greatest hits album """". The Smashing Pumpkins discography: The discography of the Smashing Pumpkins, an American alternative rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, consists of nine studio albums, four live albums, one digital live album series, seven compilation albums (including box sets and promotional releases), five extended plays (including promotional releases), 42 singles (including promotional releases), four video albums, 23 music videos, and contributions to five soundtrack albums.  This list does not include material recorded by The Smashing Pumpkins members with other side projects. Rocket (The Smashing Pumpkins song): ""Rocket"" is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins.  It was the fourth and final single from their second album, ""Siamese Dream"", and was written by Billy Corgan.  The CD single is a valuable rarity to fans of the band as it only saw a release in Australia.  A 7"" vinyl record was also released in the United Kingdom as part of the ""Siamese Singles"" box set.  ""Rocket"" was one of the few singles that did not appear on the Smashing Pumpkins' greatest hits album ""Rotten Apples"".

Born on Limerick plantation, Berkeley County (near Charleston), his father was Daniel Huger, a Continental Congressman and U.S. Representative from South Carolina.  Daniel Elliott pursued classical studies in Charleston and graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1798.  He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799, beginning practice in Charleston.  In 1800 he married Isabella Johannes Middleton-daughter of Declaration of Independence signer Arthur Middleton.  He was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1804 to 1819 and from 1830 to 1832, and was a brigadier general of State troops in 1814.  He was judge of the circuit court from 1819 to 1830, and was a member of the South Carolina State Senate from 1838 to 1842.  He was an opposition member of the State nullification convention in 1832. Benjamin Huger (American Revolution): Benjamin Huger (1746 – 11 May 1779) was one of five Huger brothers from South Carolina who served in the American Revolutionary War.  Huger became a close friend of La Fayette, having met him upon his arrival near Georgetown in 1777, and his son Francis Kinloch Huger had a role in getting La Fayette temporarily released from prison at Olomouc in the 1790s. Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette: Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (] ; 6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834), in the United States often known simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.  A close friend of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830. Implied powers: Implied powers, in the United States, are those powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem to be implied by powers expressly stated.  When George Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to defend the constitutionality of the First Bank of the United States against the protests of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.  Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.  Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means which it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the ""general welfare clause"" and the ""necessary and proper clause"" gave elasticity to the constitution.  Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed his Bank Bill into law. Anti-Administration party: The ""Anti-Administration party"" (1789–1792) was an informal faction led by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson that opposed policies of then United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton in the first term (1789–1792) of President George Washington.  This was not an organized political party, but an unorganized faction.  Most had been Anti-Federalists in 1788, meaning they opposed ratification of the Constitution of the United States.  However, the situation was fluid, with members moving in and out. Francis Kinloch Huger: Colonel Dr. Francis Kinloch Huger (September 17, 1773 – February 14, 1855), a trained physician and artillery officer, was a scion of the Huger family of South Carolina.  A member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and South Carolina Senate, he is best known for his leadership of a failed November 1794 attempt to rescue Lafayette from captivity during the wars surrounding the French Revolution. Enoch Edwards (surgeon): Enoch Edwards (1751 – April 18, 1802, Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was an American physician and a leading Patriot during the American Revolution.  Born in Lower Dublin Township, Pennsylvania, Edwards was a member of the Provincial Congress in Carpenters' Hall on June 18, 1776, which led to the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.  He was also a signatory of the 1790 Pennsylvania Constitution.  During the war he served as attending physician for George Washington, was a close friend of both Benjamin Rush and Thomas Jefferson, and kept up correspondence with James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. Alexander Hamilton: Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and ""The New York Post"" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking. Democratic-Republican Party: The Democratic-Republican Party was an American political party formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in 1791–93 to oppose the centralizing policies of the new Federalist Party run by Alexander Hamilton (1755/57-1804), who was secretary of the treasury and chief architect of George Washington's administration.  The new party controlled the presidency and Congress, as well as most states, from 1801 to 1825, during the First Party System.  It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress, and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution.  They called themselves ""Republicans"" after their ideology, Republicanism.  They distrusted the Federalist commitment to republicanism.  The party splintered in 1824 into the Jacksonian movement (which became the Democratic Party in 1828) and the short-lived National Republican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party). Thomas Jefferson (Cleveland): Thomas Jefferson is a bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson flanking the steps leading into the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio.  It is one of four statues Bitter created for the project, there was another bronze Alexander Hamilton and two marble attic figures, John Somers and Lord Mansfield.  Jefferson is portrayed wearing 18th Century clothes, sitting in a klismos chair holding “papers of state in hand.”  “It is a youthful and rebellious Jefferson, author of the Declaration of

The genre of ""The Warriors Gate"" is action-adventure-fantasy.","Apologies, but based on the information provided, I cannot determine the genre of the film ""The Warriors Gate.""","Be Right There: ""Be Right There"" is a song recorded by producers Diplo and Sleepy Tom, featuring uncredited vocals from Priscilla Renea.  It interpolates the lyrics from the 1992 song ""Don't Walk Away"" by Jade.  The song was also featured in the Chinese-French action-adventure film ""The Warrior's Gate"". Niōmon: The niōmon (仁王門 , lit.  Niō gate ) is the Japanese name of a Buddhist temple gate guarded by two wooden warriors called Niō (lit.  Two Kings).  The gate is called Heng Ha Er Jiang (哼哈二将) in China and Geumgangmun (金剛門) in Korea.  The two statues are inside the two posts of the gate itself, one at the left, one at the right.  Structurally, it usually is either a ""rōmon"" or a ""nijūmon"" and can measure either 5x2 or 3x2 ""bays"".  It can sometimes have just one story, as in the case of Asakusa's Kaminarimon. Bab Zuweila: Bab Zuweila is one of three remaining gates in the walls of the Old City of Cairo Egypt.  It was also known as Bawabbat al-Mitwali during the Ottoman period, and is sometimes spelled Bab Zuwayla.  It is considered one of the major landmarks of the city and is the last remaining southern gate from the walls of Fatimid Cairo in the 11th and 12th century.  Its name comes from ""Bab"", meaning ""Door"", and ""Zuwayla"", the name of a tribe of Berber warriors from the western desert, members of which were charged with guarding the gate. He Ping: He Ping () (born 1957 in Shanxi, China) is a Chinese film director, screenwriter and producer whose main filmography consists of a hybrid genre of Western-wuxia movies.

Romantic Warriors: A Progressive Music Saga: Romantic Warriors: A Progressive Music Saga is a feature-length documentary film written and directed by José Zegarra Holder and Adele Schmidt, released in 2010 as the first part of a series dedicated to progressive rock as an artistic, cultural and social phenomenon.  The project reflects the film makers' love of a music genre that has made a strong comeback in the early 21st century – four decades after its Seventies heyday – although without regaining the commercial appeal of the original movement.  ""Romantic Warriors"" was positively received by long-time followers of the genre, and sparked interest also outside the boundaries of the progressive rock fandom. 2004–05 Golden State Warriors season: The 2004–05 NBA season was the Warriors' 59th season in the National Basketball Association, and 43rd season in the San Francisco Bay Area.  During the offseason, the Warriors signed free agent Derek Fisher.  Under new head coach Mike Montgomery, the Warriors stumbled out of the gate losing their first six games on their way to an awful 3–12 start.  Their struggles continued posting a nine-game losing streak in January, losing 14 of their 15 games during the month.  At midseason, the team traded Speedy Claxton to the New Orleans Hornets for All-Star guard Baron Davis, and dealt Clifford Robinson to the New Jersey Nets.  The deal to acquire Davis would have an immediate impact as suddenly the Warriors became competitive, winning eight straight games between March and April, finishing tied in last place in the Pacific Division with a 34–48 record.  Jason Richardson led the team in scoring with 21.7 points per game. Ayerdhal: Yal Ayerdhal (26 January 195927 October 2015) was a French thriller and science fiction writer from Lyon.  His later work preferred the thriller genre; ""Transparences"", ""Resurgences"" and ""Rainbow Warriors"" play with various genres.  ""Rainbow Warriors"" (published at the end of May 2013) flirts with political fiction with most protagonists being LGTBQ.  He received the Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire in 2004 for ""Transparences"" and in 1993 for his novel ""Demain une oasis"".  He is considered one of the leading names in both genres.  He shared the Prix Tour Eiffel with co-author Jean-Claude Dunyach for their 1999 novel ""Étoiles mourantes"".  He also received an award for his novel ""Parleur ou les chroniques d'un rêve enclavé"" and two for ""Transparences"", a thriller.  He also received the Cyrano award for lifetime achievement in the service of genre fiction and its actors.

Sheffield United F.C. league record by opponent: Sheffield United Football Club is an English association football club based at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, who currently compete in Football League One.  Founded in 1889, they played only friendlies during their first year in existence before being elected to the Midland Counties League for the 1890–91 season.  The football committee (who ran the club at the time) were unhappy with the quality of the Midland Counties League and so resigned in the summer of 1891.  However, United were refused entry into The Football League amidst an acrimonious dispute with local rivals The Wednesday who had lobbied against their application.  Instead United joined the newly formed Northern League which mainly consisted of teams from the North East of England, resulting in their nearest away fixture being at Darlington, some 85 miles away.  Sheffield United again applied for election to The Football League the following year, this time being successful, and were admitted to the new Second Division in 1892.  Despite the club's desire to be part of the Football League some committee members felt it may not last and so United remained with the Northern League for one more season, thus competing in two leagues concurrently during the 1892–93 season.  Since that time United have remained in either the Football League, or at times the Premier League (during the 1992–93, 1993–94 and 2006–07 seasons), although changing fortunes have meant that they have competed in all four of the top divisions in England at some stage.

Stade des Alpes: The Stade des Alpes is a rugby and football stadium in Grenoble, France.  The stadium seats 20,068 and hosts the home games of Grenoble Foot 38 and the FC Grenoble rugby club.  Situated in Paul Mistral Park, it replaced their stadium Stade Lesdiguières.  It was built while GF38 played in the top divisions of French football, and had become somewhat of a white elephant now that the club plays in the 4th division and attracts few fans.  However, the stadium gained greater viability once FC Grenoble earned their most recent promotion to the Top 14 in 2012.  Since 2014–15, with FC Grenoble now consolidated in Top 14, the club have changed their primary home from their traditional ground, Stade Lesdiguières, to Stade des Alpes.

The metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft does not specifically offer any kind of help to musicians. These operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, are general-purpose operating systems that cater to various sectors of the computing industry. However, there are software applications and programs available on Microsoft Windows that musicians can utilize for their specific needs, such as music production software or digital audio workstations.","Winsingad: WinSingad is a Microsoft Windows based software for singing training. MacOS: macOS (pronounced ; previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's Macintosh computers (""Macs"").  It has been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002.  Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows. Macintosh operating systems: The family of Macintosh operating systems developed by Apple Inc. includes the graphical user interface-based operating systems it has designed for use with its Macintosh series of personal computers since 1984, as well as the related system software it once created for compatible third-party systems. Windows 98: Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis while in development) is a graphical operating system by Microsoft.  It is the second major release in the Windows 9x line of operating systems and the successor to Windows 95.  It was released to manufacturing on May 15, 1998 and to retail on June 25, 1998. MS-DOS: MS-DOS ( ; acronym for ""Microsoft Disk Operating System"") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft.  Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as ""DOS"" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system).  MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system. Microsoft Windows: Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft.  It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture.  Active Windows families include Windows NT and Windows Embedded; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server.  Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. EPOC (operating system): EPOC is a discontinued family of graphical operating systems developed by Psion for portable devices, primarily PDAs.  EPOC came from epoch, the beginning of an era, but was backfitted by the engineers to ""Electronic Piece Of Cheese"".  It was succeeded by Symbian in 1998. Windows NT 4.0: Windows NT 4.0 is a preemptively multitasked graphical operating system, designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor computers.  It was part of Microsoft's Windows NT family of operating systems and was released to manufacturing on 31 July 1996.  It is a 32-bit operating system available in both workstation and server editions with a graphical environment similar to that of Windows 95. Advanced Comprehensive Operating System: Advanced Comprehensive Operating System is a family of mainframe computer operating systems developed by NEC for the Japanese market.  It consists of three systems, based on the General Comprehensive Operating System family developed by General Electric, Honeywell, and Bull.  Two of these systems, ACOS-2 (based on GCOS 4) and ACOS-4 (based on GCOS 7) are still sold, although only ACOS-4 is under active development.  ACOS-6 (based on GCOS 8) is an obsolete high-end mainframe platform, which ceased active development in the early 2000s. Usage share of desktop operating systems: The usage share of desktop operating systems is the percentage of the operating systems (OS) used in computers (approximately market share) with so-called (retronym) desktop operating system, that also run on e.g. laptops. Originally the only computers running those operating systems, where desktop computers, while with the introduction of so-called new class of mobile operating systems, desktop got to be the part of the name of the former class of OSes.  The computers running these OSes have the desktop metaphor style of GUI, unlike the mobile OSes.  See also usage share of operating systems for breakdown of the share of desktop, mobile (and other styles of) operating systems, separately, and share of those all operating systems as part of across classes.
